  <h2>Chapter II. Non-logical Conduct<sup><a href="#footnote-c02-01" id="ref-c02-01">1</a></sup></h2>

  <p id="section-0145">
    <strong>145.</strong>
    So far we have stated our attitude in writing these volumes and the
    field in which we intend to remain. Now we are to study human conduct, the
    states of mind to which it corresponds and the ways in which they express
    themselves, in order to arrive eventually at our goal, which is to discover
    the forms of society. We are following the inductive method. We have no
    preconceptions, no <i>a priori</i> notions. We find certain facts before us. We
    describe them, classify them, determine their character, ever on the watch
    for some uniformity (law) in the relationships between them. In this chapter
    we begin to interest ourselves in human
    actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-0145-01" id="ref-0145-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0146">
    <strong>146.</strong>
    This is the first step we take along the path of induction. If we were
    to find, for instance, that all human actions corresponded to
    logico-experimental theories, or that such actions were the most important,
    others having to be regarded as phenomena of social pathology deviating from
    a normal type, our course evidently would be entirely different from what it
    would be if many of the more important human actions proved to correspond to
    theories that are not logico-experimental.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0147">
    <strong>147.</strong>
    Let us accordingly examine actions from the standpoint of
    their logico-experimental character. But in order to do that we must first
    try to classify them, and in that effort we propose to follow the principles
    of the classificalion called natural in botany and zoology, whereby objects
    on the whole presenting similar characteristics are grouped together. In the
    case of botany Tournefort's classification was very wisely abandoned. It
    divided plants into "herbs" and "trees," and so came to separate entities
    that as a matter of fact present close resemblances. The so-called natural
    method nowadays preferred does away with all divisions of that kind and
    takes as its norm the characteristics of plants in the mass, putting like
    with like and keeping the unlike distinct. Can we find similar groupings to
    classify the actions of human beings?
  </p>

  <p id="section-0148">
    <strong>148.</strong>
    It is not actions as we find them in the concrete that we are called
    upon to classify, but the elements constituting them. So the chemist
    classifies elements and compounds of elements, whereas in nature what he
    finds is mixtures of compounds. Concrete actions are synthetic&mdash;they
    originate in mixtures, in varying degrees, of the elements we are to
    classify.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0149">
    <strong>149.</strong>
    Every social phenomenon may be considered under two aspects: as it is
    in reality, and as it presents itself to the mind of this or that human
    being. The first aspect we shall call
    <i>objective</i>, the second <i>subjective</i> (§§
    <a href="01.html#section-0094">94</a> f.). Such a division is necessary,
    for we cannot put in one same class
    the operations performed by a chemist in his laboratory and the operations
    performed by a person practising magic; the conduct of Greek sailors in
    plying their oars to drive their ship over the water and the sacrifices they
    offered to Poseidon to make sure of a safe and rapid voyage. In Rome the
    Laws of the XII Tables punished anyone casting a spell on a harvest. We
    choose to distinguish such an act from the act of burning a field of grain.
  </p>
  <p>
    We must not be misled by the names we give to the two classes. In reality
    both are subjective, for all human knowledge is subjective. They are to be
    distinguished not so much by any difference in nature as in view of the
    greater or lesser fund of factual knowledge
    that we ourselves have. We know, or think we know, that sacrifices to
    Poseidon have no effect whatsoever upon a voyage. We therefore distinguish
    them from other acts which (to our best knowledge, at least) are capable of
    having such effect. If at some future time we were to discover that we have
    been mistaken, that sacrifices to Poseidon are very influential in securing
    a favourable voyage, we should have to reclassify them with actions capable
    of such influence. All that of course is pleonastic. It amounts to saying
    that when a person makes a classification, he does so according to the
    knowledge he has. One cannot imagine how things could be otherwise.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0150">
    <strong>150.</strong>
    There are actions that use means appropriate to ends and which
    logically link means with ends. There are other actions in which those
    traits are missing. The two sorts of conduct are very different according as
    they are considered under their objective or their subjective aspect. From
    the subjective point of view nearly all human actions belong to the logical
    class. In the eyes of the Greek mariners sacrifices to Poseidon and rowing
    with oars were equally logical means of navigation. To avoid verbosities
    which could only prove annoying, we had better give names to these types of
    conduct.<sup><a href="#footnote-0150-01" id="ref-0150-01">1</a></sup>
    Suppose we apply the term <i>logical actions</i> to actions that
    logically conjoin means to ends not only from the standpoint of the subject
    performing them, but from the standpoint of other persons who have a more
    extensive knowledge&mdash;in other words, to actions that are logical both
    subjectively and objectively in the sense just explained. Other actions we
    shall call <i>non-logical</i> (by no means the same as "illogical"). This latter
    class we shall subdivide into a number of varieties.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0151">
    <strong>151.</strong>
    A synoptic picture of the classification will prove useful:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Genera and species</th>
      <th colspan="2">Have the actions logical ends and purposes?</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td><i>Objectively?</i></td>
      <td><i>Subjectively?</i></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>No</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3<i>α</i>, 4<i>α</i></td>
      <td colspan="2">The objective end would be accepted by the subject if he knew it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3<i>β</i>, 4<i>β</i></td>
      <td colspan="2">The objective end would be rejected by the subject if he knew it.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    The ends and purposes here in question are immediate ends and purposes. We
    choose to disregard the indirect. The objective end is a real one, located
    within the field of observation and experience, and not an imaginary end,
    located outside that field. An imaginary end may, on the other hand,
    constitute a subjective purpose.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0152">
    <strong>152.</strong>
    Logical actions are very numerous among civilized peoples. Actions
    connected with the arts and sciences belong to that class, at least for
    artists and scientists. For those who physically perform them in mere
    execution of orders from superiors, there may be among them non-logical
    actions of our II-4 type. The actions dealt with in political economy also
    belong in very great part in the class of logical actions. In the same class
    must be located, further, a certain number of actions connected with
    military, political, legal, and similar activities.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0153">
    <strong>153.</strong>
    So at the very first glance induction leads to the discovery that
    non-logical actions play an important part in society. Let us therefore
    proceed with our examination of them.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0154">
    <strong>154.</strong>
    First of all, in order to get better acquainted with these non-logical
    actions, suppose we look at a few examples. Many others will find their
    proper places in chapters to follow. Here are some illustrations of actions
    of Class II:
  </p>
  <p>
    Genera 1 and 3, which have no subjective purpose, are of scant importance to
    the human race. Human beings have a very conspicuous tendency to paint a
    varnish of logic over their conduct. Nearly all human actions therefore work
    their way into genera 2 and 4. Many actions performed in deference to
    courtesy and custom might be put in genus 1. But very very often people give
    some reason or other to justify such conduct, and that transfers it to genus
    2. Ignoring the indirect motive involved in the fact that a person violating
    common usages incurs criticism and dislike, we might find a certain number
    of actions to place in genera 1 and 3.
  </p>
  <p>
    Says Hesiod:<sup><a href="#footnote-0154-01" id="ref-0154-01">1</a></sup>
    "Do not make water at the mouth of a river emptying into the
    sea, nor into a spring. You must avoid that. Do not lighten your bowels
    there, for it is not good to do so." The precept not to befoul rivers at
    their mouths belongs to genus 1. No objective or subjective end or purpose
    is apparent in the avoidance of such pollution. The precept not to befoul
    drinking-water belongs to genus 3. It has an objective purpose that Hesiod
    may not have known, but which is familiar to moderns: to prevent contagion
    from certain diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is probable that not a few actions of genera 1 and 3 are common among
    savages and primitive peoples. But travellers are bent on learning at all
    costs the reasons for the conduct they observe. So in one way or another
    they finally obtain answers that transfer the conduct to genera 2 and 4.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0155">
    <strong>155.</strong>
    Granting that animals do not reason, we can place nearly all their
    so-called instinctive acts in genus 3. Some may even go in 1. Genus 3 is the
    pure type of the non-logical action, and a study of it as it appears in
    animals will help to an understanding of non-logical conduct in human
    beings.
  </p>

    Of the insects called Eumenes (pseudo-wasps) Blanchard writes that, like
    other Hymenoptera, they "suck the nectar of flowers when they are full grown
    [but that] their larvae feed only upon living prey; and since, like the
    larvae of wasps and bees, they are apodal and incapable of procuring food,
    they would perish at once if left to themselves. What happens, then, may be
    foreseen. The mother herself has to procure food for her young. That
    industrious little animal, who herself lives only on the honey of flowers,
    wages war upon the tribe of insects to assure a livelihood for her
    offspring. In order to stock its nest with victuals, this Hymenopteron
    nearly always attacks particular species of insects, and it knows how to
    find such species without any trouble, though to the scientist who hunts for
    them they seem very rare indeed. The female stings her victims with her dart
    and carries them to her nest. The insect so smitten does not die at once. It
    is left in a deep coma, which renders it incapable of moving or defending
    itself. The larvae are hatched in close proximity to the provisions that
    have been laboriously accumulated by the mother, and find within their reach
    a food adapted to their needs and in quantities sufficient for their whole
    life as larvae. Nothing is more amazing than this marvellous foresight; and
    it is altogether instinctive, it would seem. In laying her eggs every female
    prepares food for young whom she will never see; for by the time they are
    hatched she will long since have ceased to
    live."<sup><a href="#footnote-0155-01" id="ref-0155-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Other Hymenoptera, the Cerceres, attack Coleoptera. Here the action,
    subjectively non-logical, shows a marvellous objective logic. Suppose we let
    Fabre speak for himself. He observes that, in order to paralyze its prey,
    the Hymenopteron has first to find Coleoptera either with three thoracic
    ganglia very close together, contiguous in fact, or with the two rear
    ganglia joined. "That, really, is the prey they need. These Coleoptera, with
    motor centres situated so close together as to touch, forming a single mass
    and standing in intimate mutual connexions, can thus be paralyzed at a
    single thrust; or if several stings are needed, the ganglia that require
    treatment will at least lie together under the point of the stinger."
    Further along: "Out of the vast numbers of Coleoptera upon which the
    Cerceres might inflict their depredations, only two groups, the weevils and
    the Buprestes, fulfil the indispensable conditions. They live far from
    infested and noisome places, for which, it may be, the fastidious huntress
    has an unconquerable repugnance. Their numerous representatives vary in
    size, proportionate to the sizes of the various pirates, who are thus free
    to select their victims at pleasure. They, more than all others, are
    vulnerable at the one point where the stinger of the Hymenopteron can
    penetrate with success: for at that point the motor centres of the feet and
    wings are concentrated in such a way as to be readily accessible to the
    stinger. These three thoracic ganglia of the weevil lie very close together,
    the last two touching. In the Buprestes the second and third ganglia blend
    in a single bulky mass a short distance from the first. Now it is the
    weevils and the Buprestes precisely, to the absolute exclusion of all other
    prey, that we find hunted by the eight species of Cerceres that lay in
    stores of
    Coleoptera."<sup><a href="#footnote-0155-02" id="ref-0155-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0156">
    <strong>156.</strong>
    For that matter, a certain number of actions in animals evince
    reasoning of a kind, or better, a sort of adaptation of means to ends as
    circumstances change. Says Fabre, whom we quote at such length because he
    has studied the subject better than anybody
    else:<sup><a href="#footnote-0156-01" id="ref-0156-01">1</a></sup>
    "For instinct nothing is
    difficult, so long as the act does not extrude from the fixed cycle that is
    the animal's birthright. For instinct also nothing is easy if the act has to
    deviate from the rut habitually followed. The insect that amazes for its
    high perspicacity will an instant later, when confronted with the simplest
    situation foreign to its ordinary practice, astound for its
    stupidity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Distinguishable in the psychic life of the insect are two wholly different
    domains. The one is instinct proper, the unconscious impulse that guides the
    animal in the marvellous achievements of its
    industry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is instinct,
    and nothing but instinct, that makes a mother build a nest for a family she
    will never know, which counsels a supply of food for an unknowable
    posterity, which steers the dart toward the nerve-centre of the
    prey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    with a view to keeping provisions fresh.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    But for all of its unbending,
    unconscious cleverness, pure instinct, all by itself, would leave the insect
    disarmed in its perpetual battle with circumstance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    A guide is necessary
    to devise, accept, refuse, select, prefer this, ignore that&mdash;in a word,
    take advantage of the usables occasion offers. Such a guide the
    insect certainly has and even to a very conspicuous degree. It is the second
    domain of his psychic life. In it he is conscious and teachable by
    experience. Not daring to call that rudimentary aptitude intelligence, a
    title too exalted for it, I will call it <i>discernment</i>."
  </p>

  <p id="section-0157">
    <strong>157.</strong>
    Qualitatively (§
    <a href="01.html#footnote-0144-01">144<sup>1</sup></a>),
    phenomena are virtually the same in human
    beings; but quantitatively, the field of logical behaviour, exceedingly
    limited in the case of animals, becomes very far-reaching in mankind. All
    the same, many many human actions, even today among the most civilized
    peoples, are performed instinctively, mechanically, in pursuance of habit;
    and that is more generally observable still in the past and among less
    civilized peoples. There are cases in which it is apparent that the
    effectiveness of certain rites is believed in instinctively, and not as a
    logical consequence of the religion that practises them
    (§ <a href="#section-0952">952</a>). Says
    Fabre:<sup><a href="#footnote-0157-01" id="ref-0157-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    "The various instinctive acts of insects are therefore inevitably linked
    together. Because a certain thing has just been done, another must
    unavoidably be done to complete it or prepare the way for its completion
    [That is the case with many human actions also.], and the two acts are so
    strictly correlated that the performance of the first entails the
    performance of the second, even when by some fortuitous circumstance the
    second may have become not only unseasonable, but at times even contrary to
    the animal's interests."
  </p>
  <p>
    But even in the animal one detects a seed of the logic that is to come to
    such luxuriant flower in the human being. After describing how he tricked
    certain insects that obstinately persisted in useless acts, Fabre adds: "But
    the yellow-winged Sphex does not always let himself be fooled by the game of
    pulling his cricket away. There are chosen clans in his tribe, families of
    brainy wit, that, after a few disappointments, perceive the wiles of the
    trickster and find ways to checkmate them. But such revolutionaries,
    candidates for progress, are the small minority. The rest, stubborn
    conservators of the good old-fashioned ways, are the <i>hoi polloi</i>, the
    majority."
  </p>
  <p>
    This remark should be remembered, for the conflict between a tendency to
    combinations, which is responsible for innovations, and
    a tendency to permanence in groups of sensations, which promotes stability,
    may put us in the way of explaining many things about human societies
    (Chapter XII).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0158">
    <strong>158.</strong>
    The formation of human language is no whit less marvellous than the
    instinctive conduct of insects. It would be absurd to claim that the theory
    of grammar preceded the practice of speech. It certainly followed, and human
    beings have created most subtle grammatical structures without any knowledge
    of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take the Greek language as an example. If one chose to go farther back to
    some Indo-European language from which Greek would be derived, our
    contentions would hold <i>a fortiori</i>, because the chance of any grammatical
    abstraction would be less and less probable. We cannot imagine that the
    Greeks one day got together and decided what their system of conjugation was
    to be. Usage alone made such a masterpiece of the Greek verb. In Attic Greek
    there is the augment, which is the sign of the past in historical tenses;
    and, for a very subtle nuance, besides the syllabic augment there is the
    temporal (quantitative) augment, which consists in a lengthening of the
    initial vowel. The conception of the aorist, and its functions in syntax,
    are inventions that would do credit to the most expert logician. The large
    number of verbal forms and the exactness of their functions in syntax
    constitute a marvellous
    whole.<sup><a href="#footnote-0158-01" id="ref-0158-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0159">
    <strong>159.</strong>
    In Rome, the general invested with the <i>imperium</i> had to take the
    auspices on the Capitol before he could leave the city. He could do that
    only in Rome. One cannot imagine that that provision had originally the
    political purpose that it eventually
    acquired.<sup><a href="#footnote-0159-01" id="ref-0159-01">1</a></sup>
    "As long as the extension of
    existing <i>imperia</i> depended exclusively upon the will of the
    <i>comitia</i>, no new
    ones carrying full military authority could be established except by taking
    the auspices on the Capitol&mdash;consequently by performing an act that
    lay within urban jurisdiction.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To organize another [taking of
    auspices] in defiance of the constitution would have implied transgressing
    bounds held in awe even by the
    of the sovereign People. No
    constitutional barrier to extraordinary military usurpations held its ground
    anywhere near as long as this guarantee that had been found in the
    regulation as to a general's auspices. In the end that regulation also
    lapsed, or rather was circumvented. In later times some piece of land or
    other situated outside of Rome was 'annexed' by a legal fiction to the city
    and taken as though located within the <i>pomerium</i>, and the required
    <i>auspicium</i> was celebrated there."
  </p>
  <p>
    Later on Sulla not only abolished the guarantee of the auspices, but even
    rendered it inapplicable by an ordinance whereby the magistrate was
    obligated not to assume command till after the expiration of his year of
    service [as a magistrate]&mdash;at a time, that is, when
    [being in his proconsular province] he could no longer take the urban
    auspices. Now Sulla, a conservative, obviously had no intention of providing
    for the overthrow of his constitution in that way, any more than the older
    Romans, in establishing the requirement of auspices taken in the <i>Urbs</i>, were
    anticipating attacks upon the constitution of the Republic. In reality, in
    their case, we have a nonlogical action of our 4<i>α</i> type; and in the case of
    Sulla a non-logical action of our 4<i>β</i> type.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the sphere of political economy, certain measures (for example,
    wage-cutting) of business men (entrepreneurs) working under conditions of
    free competition are to some extent non-logical actions of our 4<i>β</i> type,
    that is, the objective end does not coincide with the subjective purpose. On
    the other hand, if they enjoy a monopoly, the same measures (wage-cutting)
    become logical
    actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-0159-02" id="ref-0159-02">2</a></sup>

    Another very important difference between human conduct and the conduct
    of animals lies in the fact that we do not observe human conduct wholly from
    the outside as we do in the case of animals. Frequently we know the actions
    of human beings through the judgments that people pass upon them, through
    the impressions they make, and in the light of the motives that people are
    pleased to imagine for them and assign as their causes. For that reason,
    actions that would otherwise belong to genera 1 and 3 make their way into 2
    and 4.
  </p>
  <p>
    Operations in magic when unattended by other actions belong to genus 2. The
    sacrifices of the Greeks and Romans have to be classed in the same
    genus&mdash;at least after those peoples lost faith in the reality of their
    gods. Hesiod, <i>Opera et dies</i>, vv. 735-39, warns against crossing a river
    without first washing one's hands in it and uttering a prayer. That would be
    an action of genus 1. But he adds that the
    gods punish anyone who crosses a river without so washing his hands. That
    makes it an action of genus 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    This rationalizing procedure is habitual and very wide-spread. Hesiod says
    also, vv. 780-82, that grain should not be sown on the thirteenth of a
    month, but that that day is otherwise very auspicious for planting, and he
    gives many other precepts of the kind. They all belong to genus 2. In Rome a
    soothsayer who had observed signs in the heavens was authorized to adjourn
    the <i>comitia</i> to some other
    day.<sup><a href="#footnote-0160-01" id="ref-0160-01">1</a></sup>
    Towards the end of the Republic, when all
    faith in augural science had been lost, that was a logical action, a means
    of attaining a desired end. But when people still believed in augury, it was
    an action of genus 4. For the soothsayers who, with the help of the gods,
    were so enabled to forestall some decision that they considered harmful to
    the Roman People, it belonged to our species 4<i>α</i>, as is apparent if one
    consider that in general such actions correspond, very roughly to be sure,
    to the provisions used in our time for avoiding ill-considered decisions by
    legislative bodies: requirements of two or three consecutive readings, of
    approvals by two houses, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most acts of public policy based on tradition or on presumed missions of
    peoples or individuals belong to genus 4. William I, King of Prussia, and
    Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, both considered themselves "men of
    destiny." But William I thought his mission lay in promoting the welfare and
    greatness of his country, Louis Napoleon believed himself destined to
    achieve the happiness of mankind. William's policies were of the 4<i>α</i> type;
    Napoleon's, of the 4<i>β</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Human beings as a rule determine their conduct with reference to certain
    general rules (morality, custom, law), which give rise in greater or lesser
    numbers to actions of our 4<i>α</i> and even 4<i>β</i> varieties.

    Logical actions are at least in large part results of processes
    of reasoning. Non-logical actions originate chiefly in definite psychic
    states, sentiments, subconscious feelings, and the like. It is the province
    of psychology to investigate such psychic states. Here we start with them as
    data of fact, without going beyond that.

    Thinking of animals, let us assume that the conduct <i>B</i> (I) in Figure 2,
    which is all we are in a position to observe, is connected with a
    hypothetical psychic state <i>A</i> (I). In human beings that psychic state is
    revealed not through the conduct <i>B</i> (II) alone, but also through expressions
    of sentiments, <i>C</i>, which often develop moral,
    religious, and other similar theories.
    The very marked
    tendency in
    human beings to transform non-logical into logical conduct leads
    them to imagine that <i>B</i> is an effect
    of the cause <i>C</i>. So a direct relationship, <i>CB,</i> is assumed, instead
    of the indirect relationship arising
    through the two relations <i>AB, AC</i>.
    Sometimes the relation <i>CB</i> in fact
    obtains, but not as often as people
    think. The same sentiment that restrains people from performing an act <i>B</i>
    (relation <i>AB</i>) prompts them to devise a theory <i>C</i> (relation
    <i>AC</i>). A man, for
    example, has a horror of murder, <i>B</i>, and he will not commit murder; but he
    will say that the gods punish murderers, and that constitutes a theory, <i>C</i>.

  <p id="section-0163">
    <strong>163.</strong>
    We are thinking not only of qualitative relations
    (§ <a href="01.html#footnote-0144-01">144<sup>1</sup></a>), but of
    quantitative also. Let us assume, for a moment, that a given force impelling
    a man to perform an act <i>B</i> has an index equivalent to 10 and that the man
    either performs or refrains from performing the act <i>B</i> according as the
    forces tending to restrain him have an index greater or smaller than 10. We
    shall then get the following alternatives:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Case 1</i>. The restraining force of the association
    <i>AB</i> has an index greater
    than 10. In that situation it is strong enough to keep the
    man from performing the act. The association <i>CB</i>, if it exists, is
    superfluous.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Case 2</i>. The restraining force of the association
    <i>CB</i>, if it exists, has an
    index larger than 10. In such a case, it is strong enough to prevent the act
    <i>B</i>, even if the force <i>AB</i> is equivalent to zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Case 3</i>. The force resulting from the association
    <i>AB</i> has, let us say, an
    index equal to 4; and the force resulting from the association <i>CB</i> an index
    equal to 7. The sum of the indices is 11. The act, therefore, will not be
    performed. The force resulting from the association <i>AB</i> has an index equal to
    2, the other retaining its index 7. The sum is 9; the act will be performed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose the association <i>AB</i> represents a person's aversion to performing the
    act <i>B</i>. <i>AC</i>
    represents the theory that the gods punish persons who commit the
    act <i>B</i>. Some people will abstain from doing
    <i>B</i> out of mere aversion to it
    (Case 1). Others refrain from it only because they fear the punishment of
    the gods (Case 2). Others still will forbear for both reasons (Case 3).

    The following propositions are therefore false, because too absolute:
    "A natural disposition to do good is sufficient to restrain human beings
    from doing wrong." "Threat of eternal punishment is sufficient to restrain
    men from doing wrong." "Morality is independent of religion." "Morality is
    necessarily dependent on religion."
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose we say that <i>C</i> is a penalty threatened by law. The same sentiment
    that prompts people to establish the sanction restrains them from committing
    <i>B</i>. Some refrain from <i>B</i>
    because of their aversion to it; others in fear of
    the penalty <i>C</i>; still others for both reasons.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0165">
    <strong>165.</strong>
    The relationships between <i>A, B, C</i> that we have just considered are
    fundamental, but they are far from being the only ones. First of all, the
    existence of the theory <i>C</i> reacts upon the
    psychic state <i>A</i> and in many many
    cases tends to re-enforce it. The theory consequently influences <i>B</i>,
    following the line <i>CAB</i>. On the other hand,
    the check <i>B</i>, which keeps people
    from doing certain things,
    reacts upon the psychic state <i>A</i>
    and consequently upon the theory <i>C</i>,
    following the line <i>BAC</i>.
    Then again the influence of <i>C</i> upon <i>B</i> influences <i>A</i>
    and so is carried back upon <i>C</i>.
    Suppose, for instance, a penalty <i>C</i> is
    considered too severe for a crime <i>B</i>.
    The infliction of such a penalty (<i>CB</i>)
    modifies the psychic state <i>A</i>, and as a consequence of the change, the
    penalty <i>C</i> is superseded by another more mild.
  </p>
  <p>
    Change in a psychic state is first disclosed by an increase in certain
    crimes <i>B</i>. The increase in crime modifies the psychic state
    <i>A</i>, and the modification is translated into terms of a change in
    <i>C</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Up to a certain point, the rites of worship in a religion may be comparable
    to the conduct <i>B</i>, its theology to the theory <i>C</i>.
    The two things both emanate from a certain psychic state <i>A</i>.

  <p id="section-0166">
    <strong>166.</strong>
    Let us consider certain conduct <i>D</i> (Figure 3), depending upon that
    psychic state, <i>A</i>.
    The rites of worship, <i>B</i>, do not influence
    <i>D</i> directly, but influence <i>A</i>
    and consequently <i>D</i>. In the same way they
    influence <i>C</i> and, vice versa,
    <i>C</i> influences <i>B</i>. There can in addition be a
    direct influence <i>CD</i>.
    The influence of the theology <i>C</i> upon <i>A</i> is usually
    rather weak, and consequently its influence upon <i>D</i> is also feeble, since the
    influence <i>CD</i> is itself usually slight. In general, then, we go
    very far astray in assuming that a theology, <i>C</i>, is the motive of
    the conduct, <i>D</i>. The proposition so often met with, "This or that people acts
    as it does because of a certain belief," is rarely true; in fact, it is
    almost always erroneous. The inverse proposition, "People believe as they do
    because of this or that conduct," as a rule contains a larger amount of
    truth; but it is too absolute, and has its modicum of error. Beliefs and
    conduct are not, to be sure, independent; but their correlation lies in
    their being, as it were, two branches of one same tree (§
    <a href="#section-0267">267</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-0166-01" id="ref-0166-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0167">
    <strong>167.</strong>
    Before the invasion of Italy by the gods of Greece, the ancient Roman
    religion did not have a theology, <i>C</i>: it was no more than a
    cult, <i>B</i>. But the cult <i>B</i>,
    reacting upon <i>A</i>, exerted a powerful influence on
    the conduct, <i>D</i>, of the Roman people. Nor is that the whole story. The direct
    relation, <i>BD</i>, when it existed, looks to us moderns manifestly absurd. But
    the relation <i>BAD</i> may often have been very reasonable and very beneficial to
    the Roman people. Any direct influence of a theology,
    <i>C</i>, upon <i>D</i> is in
    general weaker even than its influence upon <i>A</i>. It is therefore a serious
    mistake to measure the social value of a religion strictly by the logical or
    rational value of its theology
    (§ <a href="01.html#section-0014">14</a>). Certainly, if the theology becomes
    absurd to the point of seriously affecting <i>A</i>, it will for the same reason
    seriously affect <i>D</i>. But that rarely occurs.
    Only when the psychic state <i>A</i>
    has changed do people notice certain absurdities that previously had escaped
    them altogether.
  </p>
  <p>
    These considerations apply to theories of all
    kinds.<sup><a href="#footnote-0167-01" id="ref-0167-01">1</a></sup>
    For example, <i>C</i> is the
    theory of free trade; <i>D</i>, the concrete adoption of free trade by a country;
    <i>A</i>, a psychic state that is in great part the product of individual
    interests, economic, political, and social, and of the circumstances under
    which people live. Direct relations between <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are generally very
    tenuous. To work upon <i>C</i> in order to
    modify <i>D</i> leads to insignificant results.
    But any modification in <i>A</i> may react upon <i>C</i>
    and upon <i>D</i>. <i>D</i> and <i>C</i> will be seen
    to change simultaneously, and a superficial observer may think that <i>D</i> has
    changed because <i>C</i> has changed, whereas closer examination will reveal
    that <i>D</i> and <i>C</i> are not directly correlated,
    but depend both upon a common cause, <i>A</i>.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0168">
    <strong>168.</strong>
    Theoretical discussions, <i>C</i>, are not, therefore, very serviceable
    directly for modifying <i>D</i>;
    indirectly they may be effective for modifying <i>A</i>.
    But to attain that objective, appeal must be made to sentiments rather than
    to logic and the results of experience. The situation may be stated,
    inexactly to be sure, because too absolutely, but nevertheless strikingly,
    by saying that in order to influence people thought has to be transformed
    into sentiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of England, the continuous practice of free trade <i>B</i> (Figure 3)
    over a long period of years has in our day reacted upon
    the psychic state <i>A</i> (interests, etc.) and intensified it, so increasing
    obstacles in the way of introducing protection. The theory of free trade, <i>C</i>,
    is in no way responsible for that. However, other facts, such as growing
    needs on the part of the Exchequer, are nowadays tending to modify <i>A</i> in
    their turn; and such modifications may serve to change <i>B</i> and so bring
    protection about. Meantime modifications in <i>C</i> will be observable and new
    theories favourable to protection will come into vogue.
  </p>
  <p>
    A theory, <i>C</i>, has logical consequences. A certain number of them are to be
    found present in <i>B</i>. Others are absent.
    That would not be the case if <i>B</i> were
    the direct consequence of <i>C</i>, for if it were, all the logical implications of
    <i>C</i> would appear in <i>B</i> without exception.
    But <i>C</i> and <i>B</i> are simply consequences
    of a certain psychic state, <i>A</i>. There is nothing therefore to require perfect
    logical correspondence between them. We shall always be on the wrong road,
    accordingly, when we imagine that we can infer <i>B</i>
    from <i>C</i> by establishing that
    correspondence logically. We are obliged, rather, to start with <i>C</i> and
    determine <i>A</i>, and then find a way to infer
    <i>B</i> from <i>A</i>. In doing that very
    serious difficulties are encountered; and unfortunately they have to be
    overcome before we can hope to attain scientific knowledge of social
    phenomena.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0169">
    <strong>169.</strong>
    We have no direct knowledge of <i>A</i>. What we know is certain
    manifestations of <i>A,</i> such as <i>C</i> and <i>B;</i>
    and we have to get back from them to <i>A</i>.
    The difficulties are increased by the fact that though <i>B</i> is susceptible
    of exact observation, <i>C</i> is almost always stated in obscure terms altogether
    devoid of exactness.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0170">
    <strong>170.</strong>
    The theory we have been thinking of is a popular theory, or at least, a
    theory held by large numbers of people. The case where <i>C</i> is a theory framed
    by scientists is in some respects similar, yet in other respects different.
  </p>
  <figure class="float-right">
    <img src="images/figure-04.png"

    <figcaption>Figure 4</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Unless the theory <i>C</i> is coldly scientific,
    <i>C</i> is affected by the psychic state
    of the scientists who frame it. If they belong to the group that has been
    performing the acts, <i>B,</i> their psychic state has&mdash;save in the very rare
    case of an individual not given to following the beaten path&mdash;something
    in common with the psychic state of the members
    of the group; and consequently <i>A</i> still influences <i>C</i>.
    That is all the case
    can have in common with the preceding case. If scientists are dealing with
    the conduct of people belonging to groups entirely different from their
    own&mdash;say with some foreign country, or some very different
    civilization, or with historical matters going back to a remote
    past&mdash;their psychic state,
    <i>A'</i> (Figure 4), is not identical with <i>A</i>.
    It
    may differ now more, now less, or even in some particular case be altogether
    different. Now it is the psychic state that influences <i>C</i>.
    So <i>A</i> may affect <i>C</i>
    very little, if at all. If we ignore all influences from
    <i>A</i> or <i>A',</i> we get
    interpretations of the facts, <i>B,</i> that
    are purely theoretical. If <i>C</i> is a strict
    and exact principle and is applied to <i>B</i>
    with faultless logic and without ambiguities of any kind, we get
    scientific interpretations.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0171">
    <strong>171.</strong>
    But the class of theories that we are here examining includes others. <i>C</i>
    may be an uncertain principle, lacking in exactness, and sometimes even a
    principle of the experimental type. Furthermore, it may be applied to <i>B</i> with
    illogical reasonings, arguments by analogy, appeals to sentiment, nebulous
    irrelevancies. In such cases we get theories of little or no
    logico-experimental value, though they may have a great social value
    (§ <a href="01.html#section-0014">14</a>).
    Such theories are very numerous, and we shall find them occupying much of
    our
    attention.<sup><a href="#footnote-0171-01" id="ref-0171-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0172">
    <strong>172.</strong>
    Let us go back to the situation in Figure 3, and to get better
    acquainted with that subject, which is far from being an easy one to master,
    let us put abstractions aside and examine a concrete case. In that way we
    shall be led to follow certain inductions which arise spontaneously from the
    exposition of facts. Then we can go back to the general case and continue
    the study of which we have just sketched the initial outlines.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a very important psychic state that establishes and maintains
    certain relationships between sensations, or facts, by means of other
    sensations, <i>P, Q, R</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Such sensations may be successive, and that,
    probably, is one of the ways in which instinct manifests itself in animals.
    On the other hand they may be simultaneous, or at least be considered such;
    and their union constitutes one of the chief forces in the social
    equilibrium.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us not give a name to that psychic state, in order, if possible, to
    avoid any temptation to derive the significance of the thing from the name
    we give it (§ <a href="01.html#section-0119">119</a>).
    Let us continue to designate it simply by the letter <i>A</i>,
    as we have done for a psychic state in general. We shall have to think of
    the state not only as static, but also as dynamic. It is very important to
    know how the fundamental element in the institutions of a people changes.
    <i>Case 1</i>. It may change but reluctantly, slowly, showing a marked tendency to
    keep itself the same. <i>Case 2</i>. It may change readily, and to very
    considerable extents, but in different ways, as for instance: <i>Case 2α</i>. The
    form may change as readily as the substance&mdash;for a new substance, new
    forms. The sensations <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    may be easily disjoined, whether because
    the force <i>X</i> that unites them is weak, or because, though strong, it succumbs
    to a still stronger counter-force. <i>Case 2β</i>. Substance changes more readily
    than forms&mdash;for a new substance, the old forms! The sensations
    <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    are disjoined with difficulty, whether because the force <i>X</i> that unites
    them is the stronger, or because, though weak, it does not meet any
    considerable counter-force.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sensations <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    may originate in certain things and later on
    appear to the individual as abstractions of those things, such as
    principles, maxims, precepts, and the like. They constitute an aggregate, a
    group. The permanence of that aggregate, that group, will be the subject of
    long and important investigations on our
    part.<sup><a href="#footnote-0172-01" id="ref-0172-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0173">
    <strong>173.</strong>
    A superficial observer might confuse the Case 2<i>β</i> with Case
    1 (§ <a href="#section-0172">172</a>).
    But in reality they differ radically. Peoples called conservative
    may be such now only with respect to forms (Case 2<i>β</i>), now only with respect
    to substance (Case 1). Peoples called formalist may now preserve both forms
    and substance (Case 1), now only forms (Case 2<i>β</i>). Peoples commonly said to
    have "fossilized in a certain state" correspond to Case 1.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0174">
    <strong>174.</strong>
    When the unifying force, <i>X</i>, is quite considerable, and the force
    <i>Y</i>&mdash;the trend toward innovation&mdash;is very weak or non-existent, we
    get the phenomena of instinct in animals, and something like the situation
    in Sparta, a state crystallized in its institutions.
    When <i>X</i> is strong, but <i>Y</i>
    equally strong, and innovations are wrought upon substance with due regard
    to forms, we get a situation like that in ancient Rome&mdash;the effort is
    to change institutions, but disturbing the associations
    <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as
    little as possible. That can be done by allowing the relations
    <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    to subsist in form. From that point of view, the Roman people may be called
    formalist at a certain period in its history, and the same may hold for the
    English. The aversion of those two peoples to disturbing the formal
    relations <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    may even tempt one to call them conservative. But if
    we fix our attention on substance, we see that they do not preserve but
    transform it. Among the ancient Athenians and the modern French, <i>X</i> is
    relatively feeble. It is difficult to assert that <i>Y</i> was more vigorous among
    the Athenians than among the Romans, more vigorous among the French than
    among the English from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. If the
    effects in question manifest themselves in different ways, the difference
    lies in the strength of <i>X</i> rather than in the strength of <i>Y</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us assume that in the case of two peoples
    <i>Y</i> is identical in both and <i>X</i>
    different in both. To bring about innovations, the people among whom <i>X</i> is
    feeble wipes out the relations
    <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and replaces them with other
    relations. The people among whom <i>X</i> is strong allows those relations to
    subsist as far as possible and modifies the significance of
    <i>P, Q, R</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Furthermore, there will be fewer "relics from the past" in the first people
    than in the second. Since <i>X</i> is feeble,
    there is nothing to hinder abolition of the relations
    <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    now considered useless; but when <i>X</i> is strong, those relations
    will be preserved even if they are considered useless.
  </p>
  <p>
    These inductions are obtainable by observing manifestations of the psychic
    state <i>A</i>. As regards Rome we have facts in abundance&mdash;to begin with,
    religion. There is now no doubt: (1) that the earliest Romans had no
    mythology, or at best an exceedingly meagre one; (2) that the classical
    mythology of the Romans was nothing but a Greek form given to the Roman
    gods, if not an actual naturalization of foreign deities. Ancient Roman
    religion consisted essentially of an association of certain religious
    practices with the conduct of life&mdash;it was the perfect type of the

    that "the whole religion of the Roman people comes down to cult and auspices

    of prophecies originating in portents and prodigies as interpreted by the
    Sibyl and the haruspices."

    Even in our day numerous and most variegated types of the associations
    <i>P, Q, R</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are observable.
    In his <i>Au pays des Veddas</i>, pp. 159-62,
    Deschamps says that in Ceylon "the astrologer plays a part in every act of
    the native's life. Nothing could be undertaken without his counsel;
    and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    I have often seen myself refused the simplest favours because the astrologer
    had not been consulted as to the day and hour auspicious for granting them."
    When a piece of ground is to be cleared or brought under cultivation, the
    astrologer is first consulted, receiving offerings of betel leaves and betel
    nuts.<sup><a href="#footnote-0175-01" id="ref-0175-01">1</a></sup>
    "If the forecast is favourable, gifts of the leaves and nuts are
    repeated on a specified day, and an 'auspicious hour' (<i>nàkata</i>) is chosen for
    cutting the first trees and bushes. On the appointed day, the cultivators of
    the plot selected partake of a repast of cakes, and rice and milk, prepared
    for the occasion. Then they go forth, their faces
    turned in the direction designated as propitious by the astrologer. If a
    lizard chirps at the moment of their departure or if they encounter along
    the way something of evil omen&mdash;a person carrying dead wood or
    dangerous weapons, a 'rat-snake' crossing the path, a woodpecker&mdash;they
    give up the idea of clearing that particular piece of land, or, more likely,
    the idea of visiting it that day, picking another <i>nàkata</i> and starting over
    again. On the other hand, if good omens&mdash;a milch cow, a woman nursing a
    child&mdash;are encountered, they proceed cheerily and in all confidence.
    Once on the ground, an auspicious moment is awaited, then the trees and
    brush are set on fire. Two or three weeks are allowed for the ground to
    cool, then another <i>nàkata</i> is set for the final clearing of the
    land.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    On a <i>nàkata</i> designated by the same astrologer, a man sows a first handful of
    rice as a prelude." Birds and also rain may play havoc with the seeding. "To
    avert such mishaps a <i>kéma</i> or magic brew called
    <i>navanilla</i> (nine-herbs?) is
    made ready.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the <i>kéma</i> proves ineffectual,
    a special kind of oil is
    distilled for another charm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    At weeding-time a <i>nàkata</i> is sought of the
    same fortune-teller. When the rice-blossoms have faded the ceremony of
    sprinkling with five kinds of milk takes place." They go on in the same way
    for each of the successive operations till the rice is finally harvested and
    barned.<sup><a href="#footnote-0175-02" id="ref-0175-02">2</a></sup>

    Similar practices are observable to greater or lesser extents
    in the primitive periods of all
    peoples.<sup><a href="#footnote-0176-01" id="ref-0176-01">1</a></sup>
    Differences are quantitative not qualitative.
    Preller<sup><a href="#footnote-0176-02" id="ref-0176-02">2</a></sup>
    observes that in Rome parallel with the world of the
    gods was a family of spirits and genii: "Everything that happened in nature,
    everything that was done by human beings from birth to death, all the
    vicissitudes of human life and activity, all mutual relationships between
    citizens, all enterprises&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    were under the jurisdiction of these little
    gods. Indeed they owe their existence to nothing but those thousands of
    social relationships with which they are to be
    identified."<sup><a href="#footnote-0176-03" id="ref-0176-03">3</a></sup>
    Originally
    they were mere associations of ideas, such as we find in fetishism. They
    constituted groups, and the groups were called divinities or something else
    of the sort. Pliny soundly remarks that the god population was larger than the
    population of
    men.<sup><a href="#footnote-0176-04" id="ref-0176-04">4</a></sup>
    When the tendency to give a coating of logic to
    non-logical conduct developed, people tried to explain why certain acts were
    associated with certain other acts. It was then that the rites of the cult
    were referred to great numbers of gods, or taken as manifestations of a
    worship of natural forces or abstractions. In reality we have the same
    situation here as in § <a href="#section-0175">175</a>.
    The psychic state of the Romans <i>A</i> (Figure 2)
    gave rise, through certain associations of ideas and acts, to the rites <i>B</i>.
    Later on, or even simultaneously in some instances, the same psychic state
    expressed itself through the worship <i>C</i> of abstractions, natural forces,
    attributes of certain divinities, and so on. Then, from the simultaneous
    existence of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> came the inference,
    in most cases mistaken, that <i>B</i> was a consequence of <i>C</i>.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0177">
    <strong>177.</strong>
    The view that acts of cult are consequences of a worship of
    abstractions, whether considered as "natural forces" or otherwise, is the
    least acceptable of all and must be absolutely rejected
    (§§ <a href="#section-0158">158</a>,
    <a href="#section-0996">996</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-0177-01" id="ref-0177-01">1</a></sup>
    Proofs without end go to show that human beings in general proceed from the
    concrete to the abstract, and not from the abstract to the concrete. The
    capacity for abstraction develops with civilization; it is very rudimentary
    among primitive peoples. Theories that assume it as fully developed in the
    early stages of human society fall under grave suspicion of error. The
    ancient Romans, a people still uncivilized, could not have had a very highly
    developed capacity for abstraction, as would have been necessary if they
    were to perceive in every concrete fact, sometimes an altogether
    insignificant fact, a manifestation of some natural power.
  </p>
  <p>
    Had such a capacity for abstraction existed, it would have left some trace
    in language. In the beginning, probably, the Greeks did not possess it in
    any higher degree than the Romans. But they soon acquired it and brought it
    to remarkable development; and abstraction has left a very definite imprint
    on their language. Using the article, they are able to turn an adjective, a
    participle, a whole sentence, into a substantive. The Latins had no article.
    They could not have availed themselves of that device. But they would
    certainly have found some other had they felt the need of doing so. On the
    contrary, it is well known that the capacity for using adjectives
    substantively is more limited in Latin than in Greek or even in
    French.<sup><a href="#footnote-0177-02" id="ref-0177-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Probably there is some exaggeration in what St. Augustine says as to the
    multitude of Roman "gods"; but making all due allowances for overstatement,
    there are still plenty left who seem to have been created for the sole
    purpose of accounting logically for the association of certain acts with
    certain other
    acts.<sup><a href="#footnote-0177-03" id="ref-0177-03">3</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    St. Augustine, <i>loc. cit.,</i> says that Varro, speaking of the conception of
    man, gives a list of the gods. He begins with Janus; and, reviewing in
    succession all the divinities that take care of a man, step by step, down to
    his extreme old age, he closes with the goddess Nenia, who is naught but the
    mournful litany chanted at funerals of the aged. He enumerates furthermore
    divinities who were not concerned with a man's person directly, but rather
    with the things he uses, such as food, clothing, and the like.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0178">
    <strong>178.</strong>
    Gaston Boissier says in this
    connexion:<sup><a href="#footnote-0178-01" id="ref-0178-01">1</a></sup>
    "What first strikes one is the
    little life there is in these gods. No one has gone to the trouble of making
    legends about them. They have no history. All that is known of them is that
    they have to be worshipped at a given moment and that, at that time, they
    can be of use. The moment gone, they are forgotten. They do not have real
    names. The names they are given do not designate them in themselves, but
    merely the functions which they fulfil."
  </p>
  <p>
    The facts are exact, the statement of them slightly erroneous, because
    Boissier is considering them from the standpoint of logical conduct. Not
    only did the gods in question have very little life&mdash;they had none at
    all. Once upon a time they were mere associations of acts and ideas. Only at
    a date relatively recent did they get to be gods
    (§ <a href="#section-0995">995</a>). "All that is known
    of them" is the little that need be known for such associations of acts and
    ideas. When it is said that they have
    to be "worshipped" at certain moments, a new name is being given to an old
    concept. One might better say that they were "invoked"; or better yet, that
    certain words were brought into play. When a person pronounces the number 2
    (§ <a href="#section-0182">182</a>)
    to keep a scorpion from stinging, will anybody claim that he is
    worshipping the number 2 or invoking it? Are we to be surprised that the
    number 2 has no legend, no history?
  </p>

  <p id="section-0179">
    <strong>179.</strong>
    In the <i>Odyssey,</i> X, vv. 304-05, Hermes gives Ulysses a plant to protect
    him from the enchantments of Circe&mdash;"black at the root, like milk in
    the flower. The gods call it moly. Difficult it is for mortals to tear from
    the ground, but the gods can do all things."
  </p>
  <p>
    Here we have a non-logical action of the pure type. There can be no question
    of an operation in magic whereby a god is constrained to act. To the
    contrary, a god gives the plant to a mortal. No reason is adduced to explain
    the working of the plant. Now let us imagine that we were dealing not with a
    poetic fiction but with a real plant used for a real purpose. An association
    of ideas would arise between the plant and Hermes, and no end of logical
    explanations would be devised for it. The plant would be regarded as a means
    for constraining Hermes to action&mdash;and that really would be
    magic&mdash;or as a means of invoking Hermes, or as a form of Hermes or one
    of his names, or as a means of paying homage to "forces of nature." Homer
    designates the plant by the words <i>φάρμακον ἐσθλόν</i>, which might be
    translated "healing remedy." Is it not evident, one might argue, that there
    is a resort to natural forces to counteract the pernicious effects of a
    poison? And so on to all the rank tanglewood of notions that might be read
    into Homer's
    story!<sup><a href="#footnote-0179-01" id="ref-0179-01">1</a></sup>

    The human being has such a weakness for adding logical developments to
    non-logical behaviour that anything can serve as an excuse for him to turn
    to that favourite occupation. Associations of ideas and acts were probably
    as abundant at one time in Greece as they were in Rome; but in Greece most
    of them disappeared, and sooner than was the case in Rome. Greek
    anthropomorphism transformed simple associations of ideas and acts into
    attributes of gods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Says Boissier:<sup><a href="#footnote-0180-01" id="ref-0180-01">1</a></sup>
    "Other countries no doubt felt the need of putting the
    principal acts of life under divine protection, but ordinarily for such
    purposes gods well known, powerful, tried and tested of long experience,
    were chosen, that there might be no doubt as to their efficacy. In Greece
    the great Athena or the wise Hermes was called upon that a child might grow
    up competent and wise. In Rome there was a preference for special gods,
    created for particular purposes and used for no others." The facts are
    exact, but the explanation is altogether wrong, and again because Boissier
    is working from the standpoint of logical conduct. His explanation is like
    an explanation one might make of the declensions in Latin grammar: "Other
    countries no doubt felt the need of distinguishing the functions of
    substantive and adjective in a sentence, but ordinarily they chose
    prepositions for that purpose." No, peoples did not choose their gods, any
    more than they chose the grammatical forms of their languages. The Athenians
    never came to any decision in the matter of placing their children under the
    protection of Hermes and Athena, any more than the Romans after mature
    reflection chose Vaticanus, Fabulinus, Educa, and Potina for that purpose.

    It may be that what we see in Greece is merely a stage, somewhat more
    advanced than the one we find in Rome, in the evolution from the concrete to
    the abstract, from the non-logical to the logical. It may also be that the
    evolution was different in the two countries. That point we cannot determine
    with certainty for lack of documents. In any event&mdash;and that is the
    important thing for the study in which we are engaged&mdash;the stages of
    evolution in Greece and in Rome in historical times were different.

    In virtue of a most interesting persistence of associations of ideas
    and acts, words seem to possess some mysterious power over
    things.<sup><a href="#footnote-0182-01" id="ref-0182-01">1</a></sup>
    Even as late as the day of Pliny the Naturalist, one could still
    write:<sup><a href="#footnote-0182-02" id="ref-0182-02">2</a></sup>
    "With regard to remedies derived from human beings there is a very
    important question that remains unsettled: Do magic words, charms, and
    incantations have any power? If so, it has to be ascribed to the human
    being. Individually, one by one, our wisest minds have no faith in such
    things; but in the mass, in their everyday lives, people believe in them
    unconsciously.<sup><a href="#footnote-0182-03" id="ref-0182-03">3</a></sup>
    [Pliny is an excellent observer here, describing a
    non-logical action beautifully.] In truth it seems to do no good to
    sacrifice victims and impossible properly to consult the gods without chants
    of prayer.<sup><a href="#footnote-0182-04" id="ref-0182-04">4</a></sup>
    The words that are used, moreover, are of different kinds, some
    serving for entreaty, others for averting evil, others for
    commendation.<sup><a href="#footnote-0182-05" id="ref-0182-05">5</a></sup>
    We see that our supreme
    magistrates pray with specified words. And in order that no word be omitted
    or uttered out of its proper place, a prompter accompanies from the ritual,
    another person repeats the words, another preserves 'silence,' and a flutist
    plays so that nothing else may be heard. The two following facts are
    deservedly memorable. Whenever a prayer has been interrupted by an
    invocation or been badly recited, forthwith, without hands being laid to the
    victim, the top of the liver, or else the heart, has been found either
    missing or double. Still extant, as a revered example, is the formula with
    which the Decii, father and son, uttered their
    vows,<sup><a href="#footnote-0182-06" id="ref-0182-06">6</a></sup>
    and we have the prayer
    uttered by the Vestal Tuccia when, accused of incest, she carried water in a
    sieve, in the Roman year 609. A man and a woman from Greece, or from some
    other country with which we were at war, were once buried alive in the Forum
    Boarium, and such a thing has been seen even in our time. If one but read
    the sacred prayer that the head of the College of the Quindecemviri is wont
    to recite ["on such occasions"&mdash;Bostock-Riley], one will bear witness
    to the power of the prayer as demonstrated by the eight hundred and thirty
    years of our continued prosperity [Bostock-Riley: "by the experience of
    eight hundred"]. We believe in our day that with a certain prayer our
    Vestals can arrest the flight of fugitive slaves who have not yet crossed
    the boundaries of Rome. Once that is granted, once we concede that the gods
    answer certain prayers or allow themselves to be moved by such words, we
    have to grant all the
    rest."<sup><a href="#footnote-0182-07" id="ref-0182-07">7</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Going on, <i>loc. cit.,</i> 5(3), Pliny appeals to
    conscience, not to reason, that is, he emphasizes, and very soundly,
    the non-logical character of
    the acts in question: "I would appeal, too, for confirmation on this
    subject, to the intimate experience of the individual [Bostock-Riley
    translation].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Why do we wish each other a happy new year on the first
    day of each year? Why do we select men with propitious names to lead the
    victims in public sacrifices?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Why do we believe that odd numbers are
    more effective than
    others<sup><a href="#footnote-0182-08" id="ref-0182-08">8</a></sup>&mdash;a
    thing [Bostock-Riley] that is
    particularly observed with reference to the critical days in
    fever.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

    These actions, in which words act upon things, belong to
    that class of operations which ordinary language more or less vaguely
    designates as magic. In the extreme type, certain words or acts, by some
    unknown virtue, have the power to produce certain effects. Next a first
    coating of logic explains that power as due to the interposition of higher
    beings, of deities. Going on in that direction we finally get to another
    extreme where the action is logical throughout&mdash;the mediaeval belief,
    for instance, that by selling his soul to the Devil a human being could
    acquire the power to harm people. When a person interested strictly in
    logical actions happens on phenomena of the kind just mentioned, he looks at
    them contemptuously as pathological states of mind, and goes his way without
    further thought of them. But anyone aware of the important part non-logical
    behaviour plays in human society must examine them with great
    care.<sup><a href="#footnote-0183-01" id="ref-0183-01">1</a></sup>

    <strong>184.</strong>
    Let us suppose that the only cases known to us showed that success in
    operations in magic depended on the activity of the Devil. Then we might
    accept the logical interpretation and say, "Men believe in the efficacy of
    magic because they believe in the Devil." That inference would not be
    substantially modified by our discovery of other cases where some other
    divinity functioned in place of the Devil. But it collapses the moment we
    meet cases that are absolutely independent of any sort of divine
    collaboration whatsoever. It is then apparent that the essential element in
    such phenomena is the non-logical action that associates certain words,
    invocations, practices, with certain desired effects; and that the presence
    of gods, demons, spirits, and so on is nothing but a logical form that is
    given to those
    associations.<sup><a href="#footnote-0184-01" id="ref-0184-01">1</a></sup>

    The substance remaining intact, several forms may coexist in one individual
    without his knowing just what share belongs to each. The witch in
    Theocritus, <i>Idyllia,</i> II, vv. 14-17, relies both upon the contributions
    of gods and upon the efficacy of magic, without distinguishing
    very clearly just how the two powers are to function. She beseeches Hecate
    to make the philtres she is preparing deadlier than the potions of Circe, or
    Medea, or the golden-haired Perimede. Had she relied on Hecate alone, it
    would have been simpler for her to ask the goddess directly for results that
    she hoped to get from the philtres. When she repeats the refrain "Wry-neck,
    wry-neck (<i>ἰνγή</i>, a magic bird), drag this man to my dwelling!" she is
    evidently envisaging some occult relationship between the bird and the
    effect she

    Long before their time, Empedocles,
    according to Diogenes Laertius, <i>Empedocles</i>, VIII, 2, 59 (Hicks, Vol. II, pp.
    373-75), boasted that he had power over the rain and the winds. On one
    occasion when the winds were blowing hard and threatening to destroy the
    harvests, he had bags of ass's skin made and placed on the mountains and in
    that way, trapped in the bags, the winds abated (<i>loc. cit.,</i> 60, quoting
    Timaeus). Suidas makes this interpretation a little less absurd by saying
    that Empedocles stretched asses' skins about the city. Plutarch, <i>Adversus
      Colotem</i>, 32 (Goodwin, Vol. V, p. 381), gives an explanation still less
    implausible (though implausible enough) by having Empedocles save a town
    from plague and crop-failure by stopping up the mountain gorges through
    which a wind swept down over the plain. In another place, <i>De curiositate</i>, 1
    (Goodwin, Vol. II, p. 424), he repeats virtually the same story, but this
    time mentioning only the plague. Clement of Alexandria credits Empedocles
    with calming a wind that was bringing disease to the inhabitants and causing
    barrenness in the women&mdash;and in that a new element creeps in, for the
    feat would be a Greek counterfeit of a Judaic miracle; and so we get a

    It is evident that here we have, as it were, a tree-trunk with many
    branches shooting off from it: a constant element, then a multitude of
    interpretations. The trunk, the constant element, is the belief that
    Empedocles saved a town from damage by winds; the ramifications, the
    interpretations, are the various conceptions of the way in which that result
    was achieved, and naturally they depend upon the temperaments of the writers
    advancing them: the practical man looks for a pseudo-experimental
    explanation; the theologian, for a theological explanation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Pausanias we get a conglomerate of pseudo-experimental, magical, and
    theological explanations. Speaking of a statue of Athena Anemotis erected at
    Motona, Pausanias writes, <i>Periegesis</i>, IV,
    <i>Messenia</i>, 35, 8: "It is said that
    Diomedes erected the statue and gave the goddess her name. Winds very
    violent and blowing out of season began devastating the country. Diomedes
    offered prayers to Athena; whereafter the country suffered no further
    ravages from the winds." <i>Ibid.,</i> II, <i>Corinth,</i> 12, 1:
    "At the foot of the hill
    (for the temple is built on a hill) stands the Altar of the Winds, whereon,
    one night each year, the priest sacrifices to the winds. In four pits that
    are there he performs other secret ceremonies to calm the fury of the winds,
    and likewise chants magic words that are said to come down from Medea."
    <i>Ibid.,</i> 34: "I record this fact also, whereat I marvelled greatly while among
    the Methanians. If the south-east wind ["the Lipz"] blows in from the
    Saronic Gulf when the vines are budding, it dries up the buds. So, as soon
    as the wind begins to blow, two men take a white-feathered cock, tear it in
    two, and run around the vineyards in opposite directions, each carrying half
    of the cock. Coming back to the point at which they started, they bury it.
    Such the remedy they have devised against that wind."
  </p>
  <p>
    Pomponius Mela mentions nine virgins who dwelt on the "Isle of Sena" and who
    were able to stir up the winds and the sea with their
    chants.<sup><a href="#footnote-0189-01" id="ref-0189-01">1</a></sup>
    In the <i>Geoponicon</i>, compiled by Cassianus Bassus,
    I, 14, several methods of saving the fields from hail are mentioned; but the
    compiler of that collection explains that he has transcribed them only to
    avoid seeming disrespectful to things that have come down from the
    forefathers. His own beliefs, in a word, are different.

    One branch shooting off from this nucleus of interpretation overlying
    non-logical behaviour ends in a deification of tempests. Cicero, <i>De natura
      deorum</i>, III, 20, 51, has Cotta meet Balbus with the objection that if the
    sky, the stars, and the phenomena of weather were to be deified the number
    of the gods would be absurdly great. In this case the deification stands by
    itself; in other examples, it bifurcates and gives rise to numerous
    interpretations, personifications,

    Capacity for controlling winds and storms becomes a sign of

    divinity, as in Christ quelling the
    tempest.<sup><a href="#footnote-0191-01" id="ref-0191-01">1</a></sup>

    Sacrifices were made to the winds. The sacrifice is just a logical
    development of a magical operation like the use of the white cock just
    described. In fact for that ceremony to become a sacrifice, it need simply
    be stated that the cock is torn in twain as a sacrifice to this or that

    Virgil has a black sheep sacrificed to the Tempest, a white sheep to the
    fair Zephyr. Note the elements in his action: 1. <i>Principal element:</i> the
    notion that it is possible to influence the winds by means of certain acts.
    2. <i>Secondary element:</i> logical explanation of such acts, by introducing an
    imaginary being (personified winds, divinities, and the like). 3. <i>An element
      still more secondary:</i> specification of the acts, through certain
    similarities between black sheep and storms, white sheep and fair

    The winds protected the Greeks against the Persian invasion
    and in gratitude the Delphians reared an altar to them at
    Pthios.<sup><a href="#footnote-0193-01" id="ref-0193-01">1</a></sup>
    It is a
    familiar fact that Boreas, son-in-law to the Athenians by virtue of his
    marriage to Orithyia, daughter of Erechtheus, dispersed the Persian fleet,
    and therefore well deserved the altar that the Athenians reared in his
    honour on the shores of the
    Ilissus.<sup><a href="#footnote-0193-02" id="ref-0193-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Boreas, good fellow, looked after other people besides the Athenians. He
    destroyed the fleet of Dionysius, as the latter was voyaging to attack the
    Thurii (Tarentines). "The Thurii therefore sacrificed to Boreas and elected
    that wind to citizenship [in their city]; assigned him a house and a piece
    of land, and each year celebrated a festival in his
    honour."<sup><a href="#footnote-0193-03" id="ref-0193-03">3</a></sup>
    He also saved
    the Megalopolitanians when they were besieged by the Spartans; and for that
    reason they offered sacrifices to him every year and honoured him as
    punctiliously as any other
    god.<sup><a href="#footnote-0193-04" id="ref-0193-04">4</a></sup>

  <p>
    The art of lulling the winds was known to the Persian Magi also. Herodotus
    relates, <i>Historiae,</i> VII, 191, in connexion with the tempest that Boreas
    raised to help the Athenians and which inflicted heavy losses on the Persian
    fleet: "For three days the storm raged. The Magi sacrificed victims and
    addressed magical incantations to the wind, and sacrificed further to Thetis
    and the Nereids. Whereupon the winds ceased on the fourth day&mdash;unless
    it be that they fell of their own accord." Interesting this scepticism on
    the part of
    Herodotus!<sup><a href="#footnote-0193-05" id="ref-0193-05">5</a></sup>

    The notion that winds, rains, tempests, can be produced by art of magic
    is a common one in ancient
    writers.<sup><a href="#footnote-0194-01" id="ref-0194-01">1</a></sup>
    Seneca discusses the causes of weather
    at length and derides magic. He does not admit the possibility of
    forecasting the weather by observation, regarding observation as just a
    preparation for the rites commonly performed for averting
    storms.<sup><a href="#footnote-0194-02" id="ref-0194-02">2</a></sup>
    He says that at Cleonae there were public
    officials known as "hail-observers." As soon as they gave warning of the
    approach of a storm, the inhabitants rushed to the temple and sacrificed
    some a ewe, others a fowl. Those who had nothing to sacrifice pricked a
    finger and shed a little blood, and the clouds moved on in another
    direction. "People have wondered how that happens. Some, as befits educated
    people, deny that it is possible to bargain with hail-stones and ransom
    oneself from storms by trifling gifts, granted that gifts sway even the
    gods. Others suspect that the blood may contain some property that is able
    to banish clouds. But how can so little blood contain a force of such
    magnitude as to work far up in the skies and be felt by clouds? How much
    simpler to say that it is stuff and nonsense. All the same the officials
    entrusted with forecasting storms at Cleonae were punished when through
    oversight on their part the vines and the crops were damaged. Our own XII
    Tables forbid anyone's laying an enchantment on another's crops. An ignorant
    antiquity believed that clouds could be compelled or dispelled by magic. But
    such things are so manifestly impossible that no great schooling is required
    to know as much."
  </p>
  <p>
    Few writers, however, evince the scepticism of Seneca, and we have a long
    series of legends about storms and winds that come down to a day very close
    to our own.

    The Roman legions led by Marcus Aurelius against the Quadi chanced to
    be caught by a shortage of water, but a storm came
    along just in time to save them. The fact seems to be well
    authenticated.<sup><a href="#footnote-0195-01" id="ref-0195-01">1</a></sup>
    So then, the why and wherefore of the storm has to be explained; and

    It may be a case of witchcraft. Even the name of the magician is
    known&mdash;in such cases one can be very specific at small cost! Suidas
    says he was one Arnuphis, "an Egyptian philosopher who, being in attendance
    on Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher, Emperor of the Romans, at the time when
    the Romans fell short of water, straightway caused black clouds to gather in
    the skies and a heavy rain to fall, wherewith thunder and frequent
    lightning; and those things he did of his science. Others say that the
    prodigy was the work of Julian the
    Chaldean."<sup><a href="#footnote-0195-02" id="ref-0195-02">2</a></sup>

    Then again pagan gods may have a hand in it&mdash;otherwise what are gods
    good for? Dio Cassius, <i>Historia Romana,</i> LXXII, 8 (Cary, Vol. IX, pp.
    27-29), says that while the Romans were hard pressed by the Quadi and were
    suffering terribly from heat and thirst, "of a sudden many clouds gathered
    and much rain fell, not without divine purpose, and violently. And it is
    said of this that an Egyptian magician, Arnuphis by name, who was with
    Marcus, invoked a number of
    divinities<sup><a href="#footnote-0195-03" id="ref-0195-03">3</a></sup>
    by magic art, and chiefly Hermes Aërius, and so brought on the rain."

    Claudian believes that the enemy was put to flight by a rain of fire. And
    the cause? Magic, or else benevolence of Jove the
    Thunderer.<sup><a href="#footnote-0195-04" id="ref-0195-04">4</a></sup>
    Capitolinus knows that Marcus Antoninus "with his prayers
    turned the thunderbolts of heaven against the war machines of the enemy and
    obtained rain for his soldiers who were suffering from
    thirst.<sup><a href="#footnote-0195-05" id="ref-0195-05">5</a></sup>
    With Lampridius the episode is further elaborated and assumes new garb. Marcus
    Antoninus has succeeded in making the Marcomanni friendly to the Romans by
    certain magical practices. The formulas are withheld from Elagabalus in fear
    lest he be desiring to start a new
    war.<sup><a href="#footnote-0195-06" id="ref-0195-06">6</a></sup>

    Finally the Christians claim the miracle for their God. On the passage from
    Dio Cassius (LXXII, 8) quoted above, Xiphilinus (Cary, <i>Dio,</i> Vol. IX, pp.
    29-33) notes that Dio wittingly or unwittingly, but he suspects wittingly,
    misleads the reader. He surely knew&mdash;since he mentions it
    himself&mdash;all about the "Thundering Legion," the Fulminata, to which,
    and not to the magician Arnuphis, the rescue of the army was due! The truth
    is as follows: Marcus had a legion made up entirely of Christians. During
    the battle, the praetor's adjutant came and told Marcus that there was
    nothing which Christians were unable to obtain by prayer and that there was
    a legion of Christians in the army. "Hearing which, Marcus urged them to
    bestir themselves and pray to their God. They prayed, and God heard their
    prayer immediately and smote the enemy with lightning, whereas the Romans He
    comforted with rain." Xiphilinus adds that a letter of Marcus Aurelius on
    the incident was said to be in existence in his time. The letter, forged by
    people more distinguished for piety than veracity, is also alluded to by
    other writers; and Justin Martyr goes so far as to give its authentic

    So the legend expands, widening in scope and gradually approximating a
    veritable novel. But not only the external embellishments increase in
    number. Concepts multiply in the substance itself. The nucleus is a mechanical
    concept.<sup><a href="#footnote-0196-01" id="ref-0196-01">1</a></sup>
    Certain words are uttered, certain rites are performed,
    and the rain falls. Then comes a feeling that that has to be explained. A
    first theory assumes the interposition of supernatural beings. But then the
    interference of such gods has also to be explained, and we get a second
    explanation. But that explanation too bifurcates according to the supposed
    reasons for the intervention, foremost among which stands the ethical
    reason, so introducing a new concept that was altogether absent in the
    magical operation proper. This new concept enlarges the scope of the whole
    procedure. Rain was once the sole objective of the rite. Now it becomes a
    means whereby the divine power rewards its favourites and punishes their
    enemies, and then, further, a means for rewarding faith and virtue. A final
    step is to move on from the particular case to the general. It is no longer
    a question of a single fact, but of a multiplicity of facts, all following a
    certain rule. This leap is taken by Tertullian. After telling the story of the
    rain secured by the soldiers of Marcus Aurelius, he adds: "How often have
    droughts not been stopped by our prayers and our
    fasts!"<sup><a href="#footnote-0196-02" id="ref-0196-02">2</a></sup>

    Other cases of the same kind could be adduced; which goes to show that the

    In Christian writers it is natural that logical explanations of the
    general law of storms should centre about the Devil. Clement of Alexandria
    records the belief that wicked angels have a hand in tempests and other such
    calamities (§
    <a href="#footnote-0188-02">188<sup>2</sup></a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-0197-01" id="ref-0197-01">1</a></sup>
    But, let us not forget,
    that is just an adjunct, by way of explanation, to the basic element&mdash;
    the belief that it is possible to influence storms and other calamities of
    the kind by certain rites. Victorious Christianity had to fight for its
    interpretations first with ancient pagan practices and later on with magical
    arts that in part continued the pagan and in part were new. But great the
    need of escaping storms! And powerful the thought that there were ways of
    doing so! So in one manner or another the need was covered and the thought
    carried
    out.<sup><a href="#footnote-0197-02" id="ref-0197-02">2</a></sup>

    In mediaeval times individuals endowed with such powers were known as
    <i>tempestarii,</i> and even the law took cognizance of them. Nevertheless the
    Church did not recognize this power of producing storms without a struggle.
    The Council of Braga in the year 563 (Labbe, Vol. VI, p. 518) anathematizes
    anyone teaching that the Devil can produce thunder, lightning, tempests, or
    drought. A celebrated ecclesiastical decree denies all basis in fact to
    fanciful tales about
    witches.<sup><a href="#footnote-0198-01" id="ref-0198-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    St. Agobard wrote an entire book "against idiotic notions current as to hail
    and thunder." Says he: "In these parts nearly all people, noble or villein,
    burgher or rustic, old or young, believe that hail and thunder can be
    produced at the will of men. They therefore exclaim at the first signs of
    thunder and lightning: 'Raised air!' Asked to explain what 'raised air' is,
    they will tell you, some shamefacedly as though conscious of sin, others
    with the wonted frankness of the ignorant, that the air has been stirred by
    the incantations of individuals known as 'tempestuaries' and that that is
    why they say 'raised air.' We have seen and heard many people possessed of
    such stupidity and out of their heads with such lunacy as to believe and say
    that there is a certain country called 'Magonie' whence ships sail out on
    the clouds and return laden with the grain which the hail mows and the
    storms blow down, and that the 'tempestuaries' are paid by such aerial
    mariners for the grain and other produce delivered to them. We have seen a
    great crowd of people&mdash;blinded by such great stupidity as to believe
    such things possible&mdash;drag four persons in chains before our court,
    three men and a woman, alleging that they had fallen from one of those
    ships. They had been held in chains for several days till the court
    convened; then they were produced, in our presence, as I said, as culprits
    worthy to be stoned to death. Nevertheless, after much parley the truth
    prevailing, the accusers were, in the prophet's words, confounded like
    thieves caught in the
    act."<sup><a href="#footnote-0198-02" id="ref-0198-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    St. Agobard demonstrates from Holy Writ the error of believing that hail and
    thunder are at the beck and call of human beings. Others, on the contrary,
    will likewise show by Scripture that the belief is sound. Yes and no have at
    all times been produced from Scripture with equal readiness.

    Doctrines recognizing the powers of witches were mistrusted by the
    Church for two reasons, at first because they looked like survivals of
    paganism, the gods of which were identified with devils; then because they
    were tainted with Manicheism, setting up a principle of evil against a
    principle of good. But owing to the pressure of the popular beliefs in which
    the non-logical impulses involved in magic expressed themselves, the Church
    finally yielded to something it could not prevent, and with little trouble
    found an interpretation humouring popular superstition and at the same time
    not incompatible with Catholic theology. After all, what did it want? It
    wanted the principle of evil to be subordinate to the principle of good. No
    sooner said than done! We can grant, to be sure, that magic is the work of
    the Devil&mdash;but we will add, "God permitting." That will remain the

    The <i>Malleus maleficarum</i> (<i>Hammer for Witches</i>) of Sprenger and Kramer
    gives a good summary of the doctrine prevailing in the fifteenth century,
    though it was also the doctrine of periods earlier and later:
  </p>
  <p>
    "That demons and their disciples can work such enchantments on lightning and
    hail, having received power therefor of God, and namely through His
    authorization of devils or their disciples, is attested by Holy Writ, Job 1
    and 2&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.whereof St. Thomas in a note on Job writes as
    follows:<sup><a href="#footnote-0203-a" id="ref-0203-a">a</a></sup>
    'We must confess that, God permitting, demons may effect disturbances in the air,
    raise storms, and cause fire to fall from the sky. Though corporeal nature
    in assuming its forms does not obey the commands of angels, whether good or
    bad, but only God the Creator, nevertheless, as regards local motion,
    [corporeal] nature is susceptible of obedience to spiritual nature, as may
    be seen in human beings, who, by sole power of the will, which is subjective
    in the soul, are able to move their members to the end of performing desired
    actions. Therefore motion&mdash;which, by its nature, not only good but also
    wicked angels can effect&mdash;is alone possible, save it be forbidden of
    God.' "<sup><a href="#footnote-0203-b" id="ref-0203-b">b</a></sup>
    The disquisition on
    the power of demons runs on and finally the authors of the <i>Malleus</i> give an
    example: "In [Nider's] <i>Formicarius,</i> [V, 4, f. R2], we are told of a man who
    was seized by a judge and questioned touching his manner of procedure in
    raising storms and whether it were an easy matter to do that. He answered:
    'It is easy enough to make it hail, but we cannot inflict damage at will
    because of the surveillance of good angels.' And he added: 'We can harm only
    those who are without succour of God. Those who take care to carry the sign
    of the Cross we cannot harm. Our procedure is as follows: First in the field
    [in question] we pray, by a magic formula, to the Prince of all the demons
    to send us one of his servants to smite whither we point. The demon comes.
    Thereupon at a cross-roads we sacrifice a black fowl to him, tossing it high
    in the air. The demon takes it and obeys. He brings on a storm and hurls
    hail-stones and lightning-bolts, but not always on the spots we have
    designated, but whither God
    permits.' "<sup><a href="#footnote-0203-01" id="ref-0203-01">1</a></sup>
    The writer continues with other stories as plausible as they are marvellous.
    We will touch briefly here on just one of them which is told by another writer.

  <p>
    The daughters of witches often have the powers their mothers
    have.<sup><a href="#footnote-0203-02" id="ref-0203-02">2</a></sup>
    "Hence it may happen and has been known to happen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    that a girl under the age
    of puberty, eight or ten years old, has produced hail and tempests." And the
    author gives an example (Summers, p. 144): "In Swabia a peasant with his
    daughter, hardly eight years old, was once looking at the grain in the
    fields. And considering the drought, and sorrowful, he wished for rain,
    saying: 'Alas, when is it going to rain?' The child, hearing her father's
    words, said in the simpleness of her soul: 'Father, if you would have rain,
    I will make it rain right soon!' And the father: 'How in the world can you
    make it rain?' 'Certainly I can, and not only can I make it rain: I can also
    make it hail and storm.' 'And who taught
    you that?' 'Mama, but she told me not to tell anyone!' " The conversation
    continues; and finally "the father led his daughter to a brook. 'Make it
    rain,' he said, 'but only on our field.' The girl then put her hand into the
    water, and in the name of her master, according to her mother's teaching,
    stirred it about. And lo! the rain fell, and only upon her father's field!
    Seeing which her father said: 'Make it hail, but only upon one of our
    fields.' When the girl did that too, the father was convinced from what he
    had seen, and reported his wife to the judge. She was seized, convicted, and
    burned; and her daughter, baptized anew and consecrated to God, no longer
    had powers to work her art."
  </p>
  <p>
    Though Del Rio quotes the <i>Malleus,</i> and another authority still,
    he tells the
    story somewhat differently, especially as to the way in which the rain was
    caused. Here we catch these legends in process of formation. Probably not
    all of this story was invented. Some such incident occurs. It is then

    Godelmann imparts various ways in which witches, schooled
    of the Devil, can produce
    hail:<sup><a href="#footnote-0205-01" id="ref-0205-01">1</a></sup>
    "They toss pieces of flint behind them,
    towards the west. Sometimes they throw sand from riverbottoms into the air.
    Often they dip a broom in water and make a sprinkling motion at the sky. Or
    they dig a little ditch, fill it with water or urine, and stir the liquid
    with a finger. Then again they boil hog-bristles in kettles, or set boards
    or timbers criss-cross on a river-bank.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Thus they make believe that the hail comes through their doings,
    whereas really it comes of the Devil, God permitting."

    Weier denies that witches have any powers, but he concedes that the
    Devil has, God permitting. Such the interpretation he devised in striving to
    save the unhappy women who were being sent to the stake. He may have taken
    it seriously himself, and such deviousness may have been required in an age
    when law and custom cramped free expression of
    thought.<sup><a href="#footnote-0206-01" id="ref-0206-01">1</a></sup>

    Tartarotti, who ascribes the phenomena of witchcraft to natural forces and

    not, without blemish of grave injustice, dispense with paying a deserved
    tribute to the most revered and level-headed Tribunal of the Holy
    Inquisition of Rome, which on these matters is guided by such moderation and
    caution as unmistakably to manifest the spirit and motive by which it is

    In our time we may say what we please about witches, but not about sex;
    and just as in days gone by, whether out of conviction or from a desire to
    please people who in this connection can only be called ignorant fanatics,
    governments persecuted individuals who discussed the Bible freely, so in our
    day, and for similar reasons, governments prosecute individuals who discuss
    sex without due caution. Lucretius was free to speak his mind both on the

    There is another analogy that sheds light on the nature of non-logical
    behaviour. As we noted in § <a href="#section-0199">199</a>,
    interpretations had to adapt themselves to
    popular prejudices, and so did law and penal procedure. The records of many
    many trials for witchcraft show that what happens is this: public rumour
    first designates the witch; public frenzy then assails and persecutes her;
    finally public authority is compelled to interfere. Here is one example
    among the countless that might be mentioned: In the year 1546, in the barony
    of Viry, a certain Marguerite Moral, wife of Jean Girard, complains to the
    châtelain of the barony that certain women have attacked and beaten her, at
    the same time calling her a witch (<i>hyrige</i>). The châtelain proceeds against
    the defendants and learns from them that Marguerite is accused of having
    caused the deaths of certain children. Exactly as would be done today, he
    investigates in order to ascertain whether the charges made against
    Marguerite are true. At first the plaintiff, she is now the defendant! The
    charge next extends to Marguerite's husband. Many witnesses testify that the
    children died, presumably through practices by Marguerite. She and her
    husband are put to torture and of course say whatever they are asked to say.
    They confess to intercourse with the Devil, just as they would have
    confessed to administering poison, or anything else. Both accordingly are
    condemned to the stake and
    burned.<sup><a href="#footnote-0209-01" id="ref-0209-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0210">
    <strong>210.</strong>
    In this instance interpretations play a very minor rôle. In the
    forefront stands the notion that death can be inflicted in some mysterious
    manner; and that concept works primarily on the minds of the plain people.
    The judges accept it too; but had it not been for the other notion that the
    truth can be ascertained by torture, one could not be sure what the outcome
    of the trial would have been. In a word, it is clearly apparent that public
    opinion is influencing the judges and that except for it they would have
    taken no action. So in our day governments have never taken action against
    sex heresy until after persistent agitation by that pestilential breed of
    individuals that forgathers in societies for the promotion of morality and
    conventions for the suppression of pornography; and our modern legislators,
    like our modern judges, for the most part accede
    reluctantly, and do their best to mitigate at least the hysterical frenzies
    of the sex-reformers.

    Witches were being burned as late as the eighteenth century, and in
    doing such things governments and the Church were abetting popular
    superstition and so contributed to strengthening it; but they certainly were
    not the authors of it. Far from enforcing belief in such non-logical actions
    in the beginning, the Church found that belief forced upon it and sought to
    find logical interpretations for it. Only later did the Church altogether
    accept it, with the correctives supplied by its interpretations.
  </p>
  <p>
    A writer who cannot be suspected of partiality to the Catholic Church says:
    "The slight attention paid in the thirteenth century by the Church to a
    crime so abhorrent as sorcery is proved by the fact that when the
    Inquisition was organized it was for a considerable time restrained from
    jurisdiction over this class of offences. In 1248 the Council of Valence,
    while prescribing to inquisitors the course to be pursued with heretics,
    directs sorcerers to be delivered to the bishops, to be imprisoned or
    otherwise punished [Labbe, Vol. XIV, p. 115, <i>cap.</i> 12].
    In various councils,
    moreover, during the next sixty years the matter is alluded to, showing that
    it was constantly becoming an object of increased solicitude, but the
    penalty threatened is only excommunication. In that of Treves, for instance,
    in 1310, which is very full in its description of the forbidden arts [Labbe,
    Vol. XIV, pp. 1450-51, <i>cap.</i> 79-84], all parish priests are ordered to
    prohibit them; but the penalty proposed for disobedience is only withdrawal
    of the sacraments, to be followed, in case of continued obduracy, by
    excommunication and other remedies of the law administered by the
    Ordinaries; thus manifesting a leniency almost inexplicable. That the
    Church, indeed, was disposed to be more rational than the people is visible
    in a case occuring in 1279 at Ruffach, in Alsace, when a Dominican nun was
    accused of having baptized a waxen image after the fashion of those who
    desired either to destroy an enemy or to win a lover. The peasants carried
    her to a field and would have burned her, had she not been rescued by the
    friars."<sup><a href="#footnote-0211-01" id="ref-0211-01">1</a></sup>

    People who see logical actions everywhere are therefore in error when
    they blame Catholic theology for the persecutions of witches. Such
    persecutions, incidentally, were as common among
    Protestants as among Catholics. Belief in magic belongs to all ages
    and all peoples. Interpretations are the servants, not the masters, of the
    thing.<sup><a href="#footnote-0212-01" id="ref-0212-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Other writers, such as Michelet in his <i>Sorcière,</i> find the cause of the
    witchcraft superstition in feudalism. But where was feudalism when the Roman
    Laws of the XII Tables were penalizing people who laid curses on harvests?
    When people were believing in the witches of Thessaly? When Apuleius was
    being accused of using love-philtres to win the favour of the lady he
    married&mdash;not to mention countless other cases? The truth is, Michelet's
    interpretation is an exact counterpart of the Christian, except that the
    "great enemy" has changed his name: he used to be Satan; now he is
    Feudalism!

  <p id="section-0213">
    <strong>213.</strong>
    But to go back to the Christian interpretations. Even granting that the
    Devil had no power to produce storms, there was no adequate reason for
    eliminating him altogether from such phenomena on that account. He could be
    brought in in another way by saying that he could foresee storms and
    therefore predict them. That explanation has been current from the earliest
    days of Christianity down to our own. The idea, in brief, is that devils
    have aerial bodies, that they can travel with great speed, that being
    immortal they have had long experience and can therefore know and predict
    many things in addition to predicting the things they are going to do
    themselves.<sup><a href="#footnote-0213-01" id="ref-0213-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    We still do not know why it is that certain rites happen to attract devils.
    Never fear! There will always be as many explanations as are asked for! St.
    Augustine imparts that devils are attracted to physical bodies "not as
    animals are by food, but as spirits are by signs compatible with their
    pleasure or by various sorts of stones, plants, woods, animals, chants,
    rites." And, with all his weighty authority, St. Thomas agrees that this is
    so.<sup><a href="#footnote-0213-02" id="ref-0213-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0214">

    From the very earliest days of demoniacal interpretation one very grave
    question kept coming up: Could magic practised with evil intent be met with
    magic practised with good intent? Constantine would permit such things, but
    Godefroi, in his commentary, disapproves of them, on the ground that evil
    things are not to be done in order to achieve legitimate purposes. Such also
    has been the doctrine of the
    Church.<sup><a href="#footnote-0214-01" id="ref-0214-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0215">
    <strong>215.</strong>
    For that matter, there are plenty of legitimate recourses, quite apart
    from exorcisms and spiritual exercises, and all demonologists go into them
    at length. Sprenger and Kramer, for instance, give the following
    instructions (Summers, p. 190): "Against hail and storms the following
    remedy may be used in addition to the sign of the cross just mentioned.
    Throw three hail-stones into the fire, pronouncing the name of the Most Holy
    Trinity. Follow with the Lord's Prayer and the Angelic Salutation repeated
    two or three times. Then follow with <i>In principio erat Verbum</i> from the
    Gospel according to St. John, making the sign of the cross against the storm
    in all directions, backwards, forwards, and to the cardinal points; then, to
    conclude, repeat three times <i>Verbum caro factum est,</i> and say three times,
    'In the name of this Gospel, let this storm cease.' Whereupon it subsides
    forthwith&mdash;provided it has been caused by witchcraft. These are held to
    be very sound practices and above suspicion [of heresy]. But if one throw
    hail-stones into the fire without invoking the divine Name, the action is
    held superstitious. If one should ask, 'Cannot the storm be quelled without
    hail-stones?' the answer is, 'Certainly, by using holy words in greater
    profusion.' In throwing the hail-stones into the fire the idea is merely to
    annoy the Devil while one is getting ready to undo his work by calling on
    the name of the Most Holy Trinity. It is better to throw them into fire than
    into water; for the sooner they melt, the sooner is his work undone.
    Nevertheless the outcome is all in the hands of the Divine
    Will."<sup><a href="#footnote-0215-01" id="ref-0215-01">1</a></sup>
    More
    gibberish follows on the ways in which a
    hail-storm can be caused or prevented. Del Rio lists numberless remedies,
    natural and supernatural, legitimate and illegitimate, whereby the mischief
    of witchcraft can be averted.

    Here we can stop, not for lack of material, for of that there is enough
    to fill a good-sized library; but because what we have so far said suffices
    to show the essential traits of the family of facts that we have been
    examining, just as a certain number of plants suffice to show the
    characteristics of the family of
    Papilionaceae.<sup><a href="#footnote-0216-01" id="ref-0216-01">1</a></sup>

  <p id="section-0217">

    The study just completed clearly shows the presence of the following
    characteristics in the family of facts considered
    (§ <a href="#footnote-0514-04">514<sup>4</sup></a>):
  </p>
  <p>
    1. There is a non-logical nucleus containing, in simple compound, certain
    acts, certain words, that have specified effects, such as hurricanes or
    destruction of crops.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. From this nucleus a number of branches, a number of logical
    interpretations, radiate. It is impossible not to observe that in general
    interpretations are devised for no other reason than to account for the fact
    that storms can be raised or quelled, crops protected or destroyed. Only in
    cases altogether exceptional is the opposite observable&mdash;the case, that
    is, where the logical theory leads to the belief in the fact.
    Interpretations are not always clearly distinguished from one another; they
    often interlock, so that the person accepting them may not himself know
    exactly what share is to be credited to each.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Logical interpretations assume the forms that are most generally
    prevalent in the ages in which they are evolved. They are comparable to the
    styles of costume worn by people in the periods corresponding.
  </p>
  <div class="double-figure">
    <figure>

        alt="Several dots are connected by lines in the shape of a tree branch: one dot at the base of the branch and the rest at the tips of the twigs." />
      <figcaption>Figure 6</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>
    4. There is no direct evolution, such as is represented in Figure 5.
    Evolution takes the form shown in Figure 6.
    The pure non-logical
    action has not been transmuted into an action of logical form. It is carried
    along with the other actions that are derived from it. It is impossible to
    determine just how the transformation has taken place&mdash;for example,
    trying to establish that from the mere association of acts and facts
    (fetishism) people went on to a theological interpretation, then to a
    metaphysical interpretation, then to a positive interpretation. There is no
    such succession in time. Interpretations that might be called fetishistic,
    magical, experimental, or pseudo-experimental are moreover often mixed in
    together in such a way that they cannot be separated, and very probably the
    individual who accepts them would not be able to separate them either. He
    knows that certain acts must have certain consequences, and he does not care
    to go beyond that and see how it all comes about.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. In the long run, to be sure, degrees of enlightenment in people generally
    have their influence on the non-logical conduct in question, but there is no
    constant correlation in that respect. The Romans burned neither witches nor
    magicians, yet they were undoubtedly inferior in scientific development to
    the Italians, the French, the Germans, and so on, of the seventeenth
    century, who killed sorcerers
    in large numbers. So, also, towards the end of the twelfth century and the
    beginning of the thirteenth, those unfortunates were not persecuted at all,
    though beyond all doubt that age was far inferior to the seventeenth century
    in intellectual and scientific development.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Belief in the non-logical conduct was not imposed by logical device of
    the Church, of governments, or of anybody else. It was the non-logical
    conduct that forced acceptance of the logical theories as explanations of
    itself. That does not mean that such theories may not in their turn have
    stimulated the belief in the non-logical conduct, and even may have given
    rise to it in places where it had not existed previously. This last
    induction puts us in the way of understanding how other things of the kind
    may have come about and how we may be mistaken when, knowing non-logical
    actions only under their logical coating, we give the logical aspect an
    importance that it does not really possess.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0218">
    <strong>218.</strong>
    All the many cases we have examined in connexion with storms had
    something in common, something constant: the feeling that there are certain
    means by which storms can be influenced. There is besides a differing, a
    variable, element&mdash;the means themselves, and the reasons given for
    using them. The first element is evidently the more important; so long as it
    is there, people experience little or no difficulty in finding the other. It
    might well be, therefore, that as regards determining the form of society,
    elements similar to the constant element just discovered are of greater
    importance than the other, the variable elements. For the present we cannot
    decide the matter. Induction is simply pointing out to us one road that we
    shall find it advisable to explore.
  </p>
  <p>
    As often happens with the inductive method, we have found not only the thing
    we were looking for, but another thing that we were not in the least
    expecting. We set out to discover how non-logical actions come to assume
    logical forms, and by going thoroughly into a special case, we have seen how
    that happens. But we have seen, in addition, that such phenomena have an
    element which is constant, or almost constant, and another element which is
    very variable. Now science looks for constant elements in phenomena in order
    to get at
    uniformities. We shall therefore have to make a special study of these
    different elements&mdash;and that we shall do in chapters following (§
    <a href="#footnote-0182-01">182<sup>1</sup></a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0219">
    <strong>219.</strong>
    Meanwhile, other inductions loom before us, not yet as assertions,
    since they have been derived from too few facts, but rather as propositions
    that we must verify as we extend the scope of our researches:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. If for a moment we consider the facts strictly from the
    logico-experimental standpoint, the policy of the Church with reference to
    magic is simply insane, and all those stories of devils are ridiculously
    childish. That much granted, there are people who infer from the premises
    that the religion of the Church is equally unsound and is therefore
    detrimental to society. Can we accept that inference? It is to be noted, in
    the first place, that the argument avails not only for Catholicism but for
    all religions, indeed for all systems of metaphysics&mdash;for everything,
    in fact, that is not logico-experimental science. It is impossible to concur
    in that opinion and regard as absurd the greater part of the lives of all
    human societies that have existed down to our time. Furthermore, if
    everything that is not logical is detrimental to society and therefore to
    the individual also, we ought not to find instances such as we have observed
    among animals (and are going to observe among human beings) in which certain
    non-logical behaviour proves beneficial, and even to a very high degree.
    Since the inferences are wrong, the reasoning must also be wrong. Where is
    the error?
  </p>
  <p>
    The complete syllogisms would be: <i>a.</i> Any doctrine of which a part is absurd
    is absurd; that part of the Church's doctrine which deals with magic is
    absurd; therefore, <i>etc. b.</i> Any doctrine that is not logico-experimental is
    detrimental to society; the doctrine of the Church is not
    logico-experimental; therefore, <i>etc.</i> The propositions that probably falsify
    these syllogisms are: <i>a.</i> Any doctrine of which a part is absurd is absurd,
    <i>b.</i> Any doctrine that is not logico-experimental is detrimental to society.
    We must therefore examine those propositions closely and see whether they
    do, or do not, correspond to the facts. But in order to do that, we must
    first have a theory of doctrines and of their influence on individuals and
    society; and that is something that we are to attend to in the chapters next
    following (§ <a href="01.html#section-0014">14</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    2. The questions just asked in connexion with doctrines also arise in
    connexion with individual human beings. If we consider the conduct of
    individuals from the logico-experimental standpoint, no name but "idiot"
    describes the man who wrote the absurdities with which Bodin stuffs his
    <i>Démonomanie.</i> And if we consider such conduct from the standpoint of the good
    or evil done to others, dictionaries supply only synonyms of "murderer" and
    "knave" for individuals who as a result of such idiocies have inflicted the
    cruelest sufferings upon many many human beings, and brought not a few of
    them to death.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we at once observe that reasoning in that way we are extending to the
    whole what in reality applies only to the part. There are examples a-plenty
    to show that a man may be unbalanced in some things, level-headed in others;
    dishonest in some of his dealings, upright in others. From that conflict two
    errors arise, equivalent in origin, different in appearances. Both the
    following propositions are false&mdash;equally false: "Bodin has talked like
    a fool and done great harm to his fellow-men; therefore Bodin is an idiot
    and a rascal"; "Bodin was an intelligent and honest man; therefore the
    things he writes in his <i>Démonomanie</i> are sound and his conduct is exemplary."
    We see by that that we cannot judge the logico-experimental value and the
    utility of a doctrine by a facile consideration of the reputability of its
    author; that we must, instead, travel the rough and thorny path of studying
    it directly on the facts. And there we are back again at the conclusion that
    will be reached by an examination of doctrines themselves (§§
    <a href="#section-1434">1434</a> f.). All
    that we shall go into thoroughly later on. For the moment let us continue
    looking over the general field of non-logical conduct.

    Worthy of some attention is the logical form that the Romans gave to
    their relations with the gods. In general it is the form of a definite and
    unequivocal contract that is to be interpreted according to the rules of
    law. If we stopped at that, we should see in the fact
    a mere manifestation of what has been called the legal-mindedness of the
    Romans. But similar facts are observable among all peoples. Even in our day
    the devout chambermaid who promises a few pennies to St. Anthony of Padua if
    he helps her to get back something she has lost is acting toward that saint
    exactly as the Romans acted towards their gods. What distinguishes the
    Romans, rather, is the wealth and precision of detail, the subordination of
    substance to form&mdash;in a word, the powerful cohesion of one act with
    other acts. And in that we glimpse a manifestation of the psychic state of
    the Romans.

    The Athenian Plato takes no interest in these associations of ideas and
    facts which disincline people to separate facts logically. In the <i>Euthyphro</i>

    begging things of the
    gods.<sup><a href="#footnote-0221-01" id="ref-0221-01">1</a></sup>
    For the Romans, and especially for Roman
    statesmen, the whole science of the relations of gods and men lay in just
    that. It was a difficult science. One had first to know to just what
    divinity to turn in a given emergency, and then to know its exact name. And
    since there might be doubts on such points, there were formulae for getting
    around the difficulty&mdash;for example, <i>"Jupiter Optime Maxime, sive quo

    they experienced an earthquake or heard of one. But they refrained from
    naming the god, as their custom was, in whose honour the festivities were

    When wine was offered to a divinity, one had to say, "Accept this wine
    <em>which I hold in my hands."</em>
    These last words were added to avoid any possible
    misunderstanding, and the mistake in particular of offering the divinity by
    inadvertence all the wine in one's
    cellar.<sup><a href="#footnote-0223-01" id="ref-0223-01">1</a></sup>
    "It is one of the principles of
    augural doctrine that imprecations and auspices of whatever kind have no
    value for those who, in starting out on an enterprise, declare they attach
    no importance to them; the which is one of the greatest bounties of divine

    All that seems ridiculous if one is disposed to argue the substance

    pronouncing the number 2 (§ <a href="#section-0182">182</a>),
    is it not evident that when one comes upon
    an insect and would avoid its sting, one must first know exactly whether it
    is a scorpion or not, and then the number that has to be pronounced? If it
    is the act more than anything else that counts, obviously when one is
    offering wine to a divinity one must do exactly the right thing and not some
    other thing. In any event all such ratiocination, whatever its value,
    occurred <i>a posteriori</i> to justify conduct in itself non-logical.

    Systems of divination in Rome and Athens differed no less than
    religions, and the differences lay in the same direction. Roman
    divination<sup><a href="#footnote-0224-01" id="ref-0224-01">1</a></sup>
    was confined to "a simple question, always the same, and relating strictly
    to the present or to the immediate future. The question might be formulated
    thus: 'Do the gods favour, or not favour, the thing that the consultant is
    about to do, or which is about to be done under his auspices?' The question
    admits only of the alternatives 'yes' or 'no' and recognizes only positive
    or negative signs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As for the methods of divination prescribed by the
    augural ritual, they were as simple and as few in number as possible.
    Observation of birds was the basis of it; and it would have remained the
    only source of auspices had not the prestige of the fulgural art of the
    Etruscans influenced the Romans to 'observe the sky' and even to attribute a
    higher significance to the mysterious phenomena of lightning. Official
    divination knew neither oracles, nor lots, nor the inspection of entrails.
    It refused to become involved in the discussion and appraisal of fortuitous
    signs, taking account of them only
    as they occurred in the taking of auspices. With all the more reason it
    refrained from interpreting prodigies."

    What the Romans could not find at home, they sought abroad in Greece
    and Etruria, where a freer imagination was creating new forms of divination.
    In the importance attached to the plain association of acts and ideas we
    must seek the explanation of one of the most extraordinary rules of Roman
    divination, the rule giving a counterfeit augury the same efficacy as a sign
    that had actually been observed. "He [the augur] could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rest content
    with the first sign, if it was favourable, or let unfavourable signs pass
    and wait for better ones. Then again, he could have the assistant augur
    'renounce,' that is, 'announce,' that the expected birds were flying or
    singing in the manner desired&mdash;a practice, in fact, more trustworthy
    and which later became the regular procedure. This announcement, the
    <i>renuntiatio,</i> made according to a sacramental formula, created an 'ominal
    auspice' equivalent, for the purposes of the individual hearing it, to a
    real auspice."<sup><a href="#footnote-0225-01" id="ref-0225-01">1</a></sup>

    The Romans dealt with substance according to their convenience, at the
    same time paying strict regard to forms, or better, to certain associations
    of ideas and acts. The Athenians modified both substance and forms. The
    Spartans were loath to change either. Before the Battle of Marathon the
    Athenians appealed to Sparta for assistance. "The Spartan authorities
    readily promised their aid, but unfortunately it was now the ninth day of
    the moon: an ancient law or custom forbade them to march, in this month at
    least, during the last quarter before the full moon; but after the full they
    engaged to march without delay. Five days' delay at this critical moment
    might prove the utter ruin of the endangered city; yet the reason assigned
    seems to have been no pretence on the part of the Spartans. It was mere
    blind tenacity of ancient habit, which we shall find to abate, though never
    to disappear, as we advance in their
    history."<sup><a href="#footnote-0226-01" id="ref-0226-01">1</a></sup>

  <p>
    The Athenians would have changed both substance and form. The Romans changed
    substance, respecting form. In order to make a declaration of war a member
    of the college of Heralds (Feciales) had to hurl a spear into the territory
    of the enemy. But how perform the rite and declare war on Pyrrhus when that
    king's states were so far away from Rome? Nothing simpler! The Romans had
    captured a soldier of Pyrrhus. They had him buy a plot of ground in the
    Flaminian Circus, and the herald hurled his spear upon that
    property. So the feeling in the Roman people that there was a close
    connexion between a hurled spear and a just war was duly
    respected.<sup><a href="#footnote-0226-02" id="ref-0226-02">2</a></sup>

    Ancient Roman law presents the same traits that are observable in
    religion and divination; and that tends to strengthen our impression that it
    must be a question of an intrinsic characteristic of the Roman mind
    asserting itself in the various branches of human activity. Furthermore, in
    Roman law, as in Roman religion and divination, there are qualitative
    differences that come out in any comparison with Athens. Says Von Jhering,<sup><a href="#footnote-0227-01"
        id="ref-0227-01">1</a></sup>
    "The written word or the word pronounced under circumstances of
    solemnity&mdash;the formula&mdash;strikes primitive peoples as something
    mysterious, and faith itself ascribes supernatural powers to it. Nowhere has
    faith in the word been stronger than in ancient Rome. Respect for the word
    permeates all relationships in public and private life and in religion,
    custom, and law. For the ancient Roman the word is a power&mdash;it binds
    and it loosens. If it cannot move mountains, it can at least transfer a crop
    of grain from one man's field to a neighbour's. It can 'call forth'
    divinities (<i>devocare</i>) and induce them to abandon a besieged city (<i>evocatio
      deorum</i>)."
  </p>
  <p>
    Von Jhering is only partly right; not words alone have such powers, but
    words plus acts, and in more general terms still, certain associations of
    words, acts, and effects that endure in time and are not easily
    disintegrated. In the often quoted example of Gaius,<sup><a href="#footnote-0227-a" id="ref-0227-a">a</a></sup>
    where a man loses his
    case by calling his vines vines instead of trees, as they were called in the
    Law of the XII Tables, one cannot see that the word had any decisive power.
    Certain associations of ideas had grown up and the Romans were loath to
    dissolve them, and worked out their law in deference to them. Anything new
    in jurisprudence had to respect forms in the various <i>actiones legis.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    "Theories<sup><a href="#footnote-0227-02" id="ref-0227-02">2</a></sup> as to the methods of voluntary transfers of
    property were very
    different in Roman and in Attic law. In Rome there were formal ceremonies
    for acquiring property&mdash;the <i>mancipatio,</i> and the <i>in iure cessio,</i> which
    had a translative efficacy in themselves independently of any physical
    transmission. Nothing of the kind is to be found in Athens. If in some other
    places in Greece a sale is attended by formalities reminding one of the
    <i>mancipatio,</i> a sale in Attic law remains a purely consensual contract, which
    <i>ipso iure</i> effects transfer of title <i>inter partes.</i> In Rome, furthermore, the
    act of transmission is of great importance as a method of transferring
    property. In Attic law it figures as a mere fact, devoid of any translative
    significance whatsoever. It appears as a simple means of discharging
    obligations, the transfer of title having previously taken place by virtue
    of the contract. Nor did Attic law, either, make the validity of a contract
    dependent on the observance of certain solemn forms.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Athenian law did
    not require any of the formalities commonly practised in other countries,
    such as sacrifices, or witnessing by a magistrate or by neighbours. Transfer
    took place in virtue of the mutual agreement, and there was no requirement
    of witnessing or of stipulation by written deed."
  </p>

  <p id="section-0228">
    <strong>228.</strong>
    But the most striking trait in ancient Roman law is not so much its
    strict observance of the word, of the form, but rather the progress that it
    makes in spite of its adherence to associations of
    ideas all the way along. The fact was clearly apparent to Von Jhering,
    though that scholar was primarily interested in another aspect of Roman law.
    After reciting several cases where ancient jurists sacrificed meaning to the
    literal expression he adds, <i>Op. cit.,</i> Vol. II-2, § 44, pp. 458-59: "These
    examples seem to show that ancient jurisprudence adhered strictly to the
    letter in interpreting laws. Nevertheless, as I see the matter, that opinion
    is to be absolutely rejected; and in proof I will give a list of cases in
    which jurisprudence undoubtedly departed from the letter of the law."
  </p>
  <p>
    Ancient Roman law was all form and mechanism and reduced freedom of choice
    on the part of litigants and magistrates to a minimum. Legal actions remind
    one of a grist-mill: grain was put in at one end and flour came out at the
    other. Says Girard:<sup><a href="#footnote-0228-01" id="ref-0228-01">1</a></sup> "The rôle of the magistrate has to
    be clearly grasped.
    He does not judge. It would perhaps be an exaggeration to say that he
    formulates the complaint. His collaboration serves merely to lend an
    indispensable authenticity to the actions of the parties, especially to the
    action of the plaintiff. As in extra-judicial procedure, it is the plaintiff
    who is asserting his right in applying the <i>legis actio.</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As for the
    magistrate, his rôle is that of an assistant, and if it is not a purely
    passive role, it is at least almost mechanical.<sup><a href="#footnote-0228-02" id="ref-0228-02">2</a></sup> He must
    be present, and he
    must pronounce the words that the law requires him to pronounce. But that is
    almost all. He cannot grant action when the law does not grant it, nor, in
    our sense, can he refuse it (<i>denegare legis actionem</i>) when the law accords
    it;<sup><a href="#footnote-0228-03" id="ref-0228-03">3</a></sup> and if there is a trial, it is not he who passes
    judgment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
    issue, formulated <i>in iure</i> before the magistrate, is decided <i>in iudicio</i> by a
    different authority. The task of the magistrate ends with the naming of the
    judge, a nomination made to a far greater extent by the parties than by
    him."

    We could continue marshalling such facts; for in all departments of
    Roman law one can detect manifestations of a psychic state
    <i>A,</i> that accepts progress while respecting associations of ideas. Detecting
    traces of it in the system of the <i>legis actio,</i> we also see traces of it in
    the formulary system, and it altogether controls in the whole department of
    so-called legal fictions. Legal fictions are to be noted among all peoples
    in certain stages of their history; but the extent of their development and
    their long survival are quite remarkable in the case of ancient Rome, as
    they are in the case of modern England.

    Similar phenomena are observable in the various aspects of political
    life. As the result of an evolution common to the majority of Greek and
    Latin cities, the king was superseded by new magistrates in Athens, Sparta,
    and Rome. But in Athens both substance and forms were completely changed; in
    Sparta changes were less marked both in substance and in form; in Rome they
    were very considerable as regarded substance, and much less extensive as
    regarded forms.<sup><a href="#footnote-0230-01" id="ref-0230-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    In deference to certain associations of ideas and acts, the sacerdotal
    functions of the king passed, in Athens to the archon-king, and in Rome to
    the <i>rex sacrorum;</i> yet neither of those offices had any importance
    politically. From the political standpoint the king disappears entirely in
    Athens. In Sparta he is kept, but with greatly reduced powers. In Rome he is
    remodelled with the fewest possible changes in forms. The supreme magistracy
    becomes annual and is divided between two consuls of equal power, each of
    whom can act independently of the other and can halt action by the other.<sup><a href="#footnote-0230-02"
        id="ref-0230-02">2</a></sup>
    "The
    constitution<sup><a href="#footnote-0230-03" id="ref-0230-03">3</a></sup> gave the consuls the right to expand their
    college, especially
    in time of war, by the addition of a third member exercising the more
    comprehensive powers of a dictator. Popular election of dictators did not
    come till a later date and by way of special exception. The dictator was
    named by one of the consuls, just as the king had probably been named in
    former times by the acting king [<i>inter-rex</i>]. This royal nomination had but
    one limitation&mdash;the fact, namely, that the consuls and their
    colleagues, the praetors, remained in office along with the dictator,
    although they deferred to him in cases of dispute."
  </p>

  <p id="section-0231">
    <strong>231.</strong>
    It is a most surprising trait in the Roman constitution that the higher
    magistrates, though in reality named by the <i>comitia,</i> seem to be named by
    their predecessors. "The most ancient popular election was not a choice
    freely made from a number of eligible individuals. It was probably limited
    at first by the right of the magistrate directing the election to make
    nominations. It is likely that in the very beginning exactly as many names
    were submitted to the people as there were officers to elect, and that, in
    principle, the voters could do nothing beyond mere acceptance or rejection
    of a proposed person, exactly as was the case with a proposed law."<sup><a href="#footnote-0231-01"
        id="ref-0231-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Even in days more recent, under the Republic, the magistrate superintending
    an election could accept a candidacy (<i>nomen accipere</i>) or reject one (<i>nomen
      non accipere</i>). And later on it was further necessary for the presiding
    magistrate to consent to announce ("renounce," <i>renuntiare</i>) the successful candidate, and if he refused, no
    one
    could oblige him to.<sup><a href="#footnote-0231-02" id="ref-0231-02">2</a></sup>

    We find nothing of that sort in Athens. There was, to be sure, an
    examination (<i>δοκιμασία</i>) to decide whether archons (who were chosen by lot),
    <i>strategoi</i> (generals who were elective magistrates) and senators were fit to
    perform their duties; but that certification of prerogative was something
    very different from the <i>renuntiatio.</i> Athens makes forms consistent with
    substance. Rome changed from kingdom to republic by dividing the functions
    of magistrates. She went back to monarchy under the Empire by recombining
    them anew. In the long series of constitutional changes which took place
    between those two extremes, forms were as far as possible preserved even
    though substance changed.

    Towards the end of his life Caesar seemed inclined to depart from that
    rule. To a people like the Athenians such a desire would have been
    considered reasonable enough. The few Romans still cherishing old-fashioned
    notions were incensed at the dissociation of ideas and acts implied in it.
    Only by mistaking the part for the whole has it been possible to imagine
    Caesar's ruin as due to the
    extravagant honours that he arranged to have paid him. They were but one
    element in a whole array of things shocking to such Roman citizens as still
    lingered in the psychic state of the forefathers.<sup><a href="#footnote-0233-01" id="ref-0233-01">1</a></sup>
    Augustus found ways to
    respect traditions better. He is prevaricating brazenly when he says in the
    Ancyra inscription: "In my sixth and seventh consulates, after ending the
    civil wars, I restored to the Senate and the Roman People the powers that I
    had received by universal consent; and in honour of that action a decree of
    the Senate gave me the name of Augustus.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whereafter, though above all
    others in honours, I have held no greater powers than my colleagues."<sup><a href="#footnote-0233-02"
        id="ref-0233-02">2</a></sup>
    Velleius Paterculus, who showers most lavish flattery on Augustus and
    Tiberius, says that Augustus "restored to the laws their former force, to
    the courts their old prestige, to the Senate its pristine majesty, and to
    the magistrates their time-honoured authority."<sup><a href="#footnote-0233-03" id="ref-0233-03">3</a></sup>

    There were still consuls and tribunes under the Empire, but those were
    no more than empty names. So under Augustus the <i>comltia</i> still met to elect
    public officials; and&mdash;what is more surprising still and still better
    demonstrates the attachment of the Romans to certain forms&mdash;even under
    Vespasian a law was passed by the <i>comitia</i> investing the Emperor with power!
    At first blush it would
    seem that those Romans must have had a deal of time to waste to be going
    through with such farces! "Just so<sup><a href="#footnote-0234-01" id="ref-0234-01">1</a></sup> was Augustus made a
    tribune in the Roman
    year 718, and thereafter his successors. After a vote in the Senate, a
    magistrate, probably one of the consuls on duty, presented to the <i>comitia</i> a
    'bill' (<i>rogatio</i>) designating the Emperor and specifying his powers and
    prerogatives.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So the Senate and the People both participated in the
    'election.'&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The form, therefore, was the form customary for
    extraordinary magistracies instituted under the Republic: first a special
    law, then a popular ratification.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The transfer of elections from the
    <i>comitia</i> to the Senate, effected in the year 14 of our era, changed nothing
    so far as the imperial <i>comitia</i> were concerned: it affected only nominations
    of ordinary magistrates, and had nothing to do with magistrates
    theoretically extraordinary."

    In such things the fatuousness of some of the logical reasons human
    beings offer for their behaviour strikes the eye very forcibly. The Roman
    jurists were not joking, they were in earnest, when they said that "it has
    never been questioned that the will of the Emperor has force of law, since
    he himself receives his authority from a law."<sup><a href="#footnote-0235-01" id="ref-0235-01">1</a></sup> But
    after all, the legions
    and the praetorians must have counted for something! The unlettered dame in
    the story was thinking straighter than the long-faced Ulpian when she said
    to Caracalla, "Knowest thou not that it is for an Emperor to give, and not

    It is a familiar fact that the Greeks had no term corresponding exactly
    to the word <i>religio.</i> Ignoring questions of etymology, which after all would
    not get us very far, we may simply remark that even in the classical period
    <i>religio</i> in one of its senses undoubtedly meant painstaking, conscientious,
    diligent attention to duties.<sup><a href="#footnote-0236-01" id="ref-0236-01">1</a></sup> It is a state of mind in

    An anecdote of Livy clearly brings out this scrupulous attachment to
    ties to the discomfiture of all other sentiments. A number of soldiers, not
    wishing to obey the consuls, began to consider whether they could be freed
    of the oath binding them to their obedience by killing them. After a time
    they came to the conclusion that a crime could not wipe out a sacred pledge,
    so they resorted to a sort of
    strike.<sup><a href="#footnote-0237-01" id="ref-0237-01">1</a></sup> It matters little whether this be
    history or fiction. If it is fiction, the person who invented it knew that
    his hearers would consider it quite natural to wonder whether killing a
    person to whom one was bound by an oath were a means of getting rid of the
    oath; and natural also to answer in the negative, not from any aversion to
    homicide, but because homicide would not be the effective way of cancelling
    an oath. This whole discussion as to the way to escape the consequences of a
    vow belongs to <i>religio</i> in the Latin sense.

    And as manifestations of the same <i>religio</i> we must regard the numberless
    facts that present the Romans as a conscientious, exact, scrupulous people,
    devoted&mdash;even too much so&mdash;to orderliness and regularity in their
    private lives. The head of every Roman family kept a diary, or ledger, in
    which he recorded not only income and expenditures, but everything of
    importance happening in the family circle&mdash;something similar to the
    day-books which Italian law requires merchants to keep, but also covering
    matters altogether foreign to the mere administration of the family property.<sup><a href="#footnote-0238-01"

    <strong>239.</strong> It
    might seem that the religion of the Greeks, in which reason and imagination
    played a more important rôle, should be more moral than the religion of the
    Romans, which comes down to a series of fictions in which reason played no
    part whatever. The contrary, however, was the case. We may ignore the
    scandalous adventures of the gods, and keep, rather, to the influence of
    religion on the conduct of daily life.<sup><a href="#footnote-0239-01" id="ref-0239-01">1</a></sup> For the Romans
    the physical acts of
    the cult were everything, intentions nothing. The Greeks too passed through
    just such a stage in an archaic period of their history: a murder was
    expiated by an altogether external ceremony. But they, or more exactly their
    thinkers, soon outgrew this materialistic formalistic morality. "Even as
    there is no remedy for lost virginity," Aeschylus will cry, "so all the
    rivers of the world gathered into one avail not to wash the blood-stained
    hands of a murderer."<sup><a href="#footnote-0239-02" id="ref-0239-02">2</a></sup> Certainly one might expect to
    find a rectitude of conduct corresponding to such
    exalted thoughts. What we actually find is the opposite. In the end Rome got
    to be as immoral as Greece; but originally, and even in the fairly recent
    day of the Scipios, Polybius could write, <i>Historiae,</i> VI, 56, 13 (Paton, Vol.
    III, pp. 395-97): "So, not to mention other things, if a mere talent is
    entrusted to those who have charge of public monies in Greece, though they
    give bond to ten times the amount and there be ten seals and twice that many
    witnesses, you will never see your talent again; whereas with the Romans,
    magistrates or provincial governors who have the handling of large sums of
    money respect their given word out of regard for their oath." The sacred
    chickens may have been ridiculous; but they never caused the Roman armies a
    disaster comparable to the defeat that the Athenians suffered in Sicily
    through fault of their soothsayers.

    mouthpiece for the spirit of the old Romans, viewed all such clever chatter
    as more than suspicious and urged the Senate to rush the business that had
    brought such individuals to Rome to the earliest possible close, "that they
    might go back to their schools and spout before the children of the Greeks,
    leaving young people in Rome to mind their magistrates and respect the laws
    as they had always done."<sup><a href="#footnote-0240-02" id="ref-0240-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Cato, mark well, does not care to discuss the doctrines of Carneades. He is
    not in the least interested in knowing whether or not their reasoning is
    sound. He is looking at them from the outside. All that captious
    hair-splitting seems to him to have no value. It can do no good and may do
    harm for young people in Rome to listen to it. Great would have been Cato's
    amazement had he known that some day people were going to kill each other to
    prove or disprove the consubstantiality of the Word or the second person of
    the Trinity&mdash;the Arian heresy; and rightly would he have thanked
    Jupiter Optimus Maximus for preserving the Romans from such folly (which,
    for that matter, in some instances, clothed a rational substance).

    Athenian law, which was essentially logical and sought to settle
    questions on broad lines without embarrassments from a stupid formalism or
    too many fictions, should have been superior to Roman law. But everybody
    knows that the exact opposite was the case. "The Greek intellect,<sup><a href="#footnote-0241-01"
        id="ref-0241-01">1</a></sup> with all
    its nobility and elasticity, was quite unable to confine itself within the
    strait waistcoat of a legal formula; and, if we may judge them by the
    popular courts of Athens, of whose working we possess accurate knowledge,
    the Greek tribunals exhibited the strongest tendency to confound law and fact.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No durable
    system of jurisprudence could be produced in this way. A community which
    never hesitated to relax rules of written law whenever they stood in the way
    of an ideally perfect decision on the facts of particular cases, would only,
    if it bequeathed any body of judicial principles to posterity, bequeath one
    consisting of the ideas of right and wrong which happened to be prevalent at
    the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    So far we agree with Sumner Maine; but we cannot agree when, <i>loc. cit.,</i> pp.
    73-74, he ascribes the perfection of Roman law to the Roman theory of
    natural law. That theory was appended to the ancient fund of Roman law at a
    relatively recent date. Von Jhering comes closer to the crux of the problem.
    His description of the facts is excellent. As for the causes, what he calls
    "the rigorous logic of the conservative spirit" is nothing but the Roman
    psychic state, of which we have been speaking above, combining with logical
    and practical inferences that entail the fewest possible modifications in
    certain associations of ideas and acts.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will transcribe Von Jhering's paragraph, putting in brackets the
    emendations that I consider appropriate:<sup><a href="#footnote-0241-02" id="ref-0241-02">2</a></sup> "If Roman
    jurisprudence found a
    simple and logical law ready-made, it owes that advantage morally to the
    ancient Roman people, which, in spite of its spirit of liberty, had
    submitted for centuries to a relentless logic [to the logical consequences
    of associations&mdash;which they would not have anyone disturb&mdash;of
    ideas and acts].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The truth of what we have just said is apparent in
    the peculiarly Roman manner&mdash;so familiar to all who know Roman
    law&mdash;of reconciling an embarrassing logic [certain associations of
    ideas and acts] with practical requirements by devices of all sorts:
    make-believe, roundabout detours, fictions. The moral aversion of the Romans
    to any violation of a principle once recognized [resulting from associations
    of ideas and acts] stimulates and, as it were, crowds their intelligence to
    exercise all its sagacity in discovering ways and means for reconciling
    logic and practical exigency. Necessity is the mother of invention.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    The
    second national trait of the Romans mentioned above, their conservative
    spirit [conservative as regards forms, progressive as regards substance],
    worked in exactly the same direction, and it, too, was a powerful lever for
    their inventive talents in law. To reconcile the necessities of the present
    with the traditions of the past, to do justice to the former without
    breaking, either in form or in substance, with the latter, to discipline
    juridical intercourse and guide the progressive force of law into its proper
    channels&mdash;that for centuries was the truly noble and patriotic mission
    of Roman juridical science. [We can dispense with the mission, the nobility,
    and the patriotism.] Roman jurisprudence towered the greater in proportion
    to the difficulties that it encountered."

    In statecraft there is better yet. We can only wonder how a system so
    absurd from the standpoint of logic could ever have survived. Magistrates
    with equal prerogatives, such as two consuls and two censors; tribunes able
    to halt the whole juridical and political process; <i>comitia</i> trying to work
    with the complication of the auspices; a Senate without any well-defined
    jurisdiction&mdash;such things seem to be loose parts of a ramshackle
    machine that could never have functioned. Yet it did function for century
    after century, and gave Rome dominion over the Mediterranean world; and when
    it finally broke down it broke down because it had been worn out by a new
    people that had lost the <i>religio</i> of the old. Thanks to ties of non-logical
    conduct and to forces of innovation, Rome found a way to reconcile
    discipline with freedom and strike a golden mean between Sparta and Athens.

    The oration on the war-dead that Thucydides, <i>Historiae,</i> II, 35-46,
    ascribes to Pericles and Cicero's oration on the responses of the haruspices
    offer a striking contrast. The Athenian speaks like a modern. The prosperity
    of Athens is due to democracy, to just laws, to the good sense of her
    citizens, to their courage. These traits in the Athenians make Athens a
    better city than the other cities in Greece. The Roman does not bestow so
    much praise on the knowledge and courage of his fellow-citizens. "However
    highly we may esteem ourselves, O Conscript Fathers, we have not been
    superior in
    numbers to the Spaniards, in physique to the Gauls, in shrewdness to the
    Carthaginians, in the arts to the Greeks, nor even to the Italians and the
    Latins in the good sense native to our soil. But to all peoples and races we
    have been superior in piety, in religion, in that wisdom which has led us to
    understand that all things are ruled and directed by the immortal gods."<sup><a href="#footnote-0243-01"
        id="ref-0243-01">1</a></sup>
    That seems to be the language of bigotry, and instead it is the language of
    reason, especially if the word "religion" be taken in the sense of the
    <i>religio</i> defined above. The cause of Roman prosperity was a certain number of
    ties, of <i>religiones,</i> which made the Romans a disciplined people. To be
    sure, Cicero was not thinking in just those terms&mdash;his theme was the
    power of the immortal gods&mdash;but the concept of the rule, of the tie,
    was not absent from his mind. He began by lauding the wisdom of the
    forefathers, "who thought that sacred rites and ceremonies were the affair
    of the pontiffs, and good auspices the affair of the augurs; that the
    ancient prophecies of Apollo were to be read in the Sibylline Books; and
    that the interpretation of prodigies belonged to Etruscan lore."<sup><a href="#footnote-0243-02"

    Among modern peoples, the English, at least down to the last years of
    the nineteenth century,<sup><a href="#footnote-0244-01" id="ref-0244-01">1</a></sup> have more than any other
    people resembled the Romans in their psychic state. English law is still
    replete with fictions. The English political system keeps the same
    antiquated names, the same antiquated forms, whereas in substance it is
    constantly changing. England still has a king, as in the times of the
    Plantagenets, the Tudors, and the Stuarts; but he has less authority, less
    power, than the President of the United States. Under Charles I we see a
    civil war fought by the King in his Parliament against the King in his camp.
    No Roman ever devised a fiction so far-fetched! Even today the ceremonies
    connected with the opening of Parliament are archaic to the point of comedy.
    Before the Commons appears a pompous individual called the Gentleman Usher
    of the Black Rod, who invites them to proceed to the House of Lords to hear
    the Speech from the Throne. The Commons repair thither and then return to
    their own chamber, where the Speaker informs them with a perfectly straight
    face of something they have heard as distinctly as he. Immediately a bill
    has to be read, as a matter of mere form, to safe-guard the right of
    Parliament to be the first to discuss public business, without going into
    the reasons for the convocation. English political organization is adapted
    to the needs of the English people, just as the political organization of
    ancient Rome was adapted to the needs of the Roman people, and all modern
    peoples have sought to copy it more or less faithfully. That organization
    enabled England to issue victorious from the Napoleonic wars and has secured
    Englishmen greater liberties than the majority of European peoples have
    enjoyed. All this is now tending to change as a result of new customs and
    new habits that seem about to get a foothold in England.

    In our discussion so far we have had to use terms of ordinary language,
    which are by nature not very strict in meaning. Keeping for the moment to
    the terms "Athenians," "Romans," and so on, used in the
    foregoing&mdash;exactly what do they represent? Among ancient peoples they
    designated citizens only, not slaves and not foreigners. But do our
    statements apply to all the citizens in
    question? From certain facts, acts, laws, customs, we have inferred the psychic
    state of the individuals who created those facts, performed those acts,
    accepted those laws and customs. Legitimate enough! But it would not be
    legitimate to pretend that they made up the whole nation, or even the
    numerical majority in the nation.

    Every people is governed by an <i>élite,</i> by a chosen element in the
    population; and, in all strictness it is the psychic state of that <i>élite</i>
    that we have been examining.<sup><a href="#footnote-0246-01" id="ref-0246-01">1</a></sup> We can, at the very most,
    go on and say that
    the remainder of the population followed the impulse given by it. An <i>élite</i>
    can change with changes in the individuals composing it or in their
    descendants, or even through the infiltration of extraneous elements, which
    may come from the same country or from some other country. When only
    children of Athenian citizens could be citizens in Athens, the Athenian
    <i>élite</i> could change only through changes occurring in its individual members,
    or through taking in new members from the Athenian citizenry at large.

  <p id="section-0247">

    Observable in Rome are not only changes of those same kinds, but also
    an infiltration of foreign peoples, now of Latins or Italians through an
    extension of the right of citizenship, now of miscellaneous elements of all
    sorts, even of Barbarians, by way of freed slaves and descendants of
    freedmen. Scipio Aemilianus was able to say to an unruly assembly of
    plebeians that they were not even Italians.<sup><a href="#footnote-0247-01" id="ref-0247-01">1</a></sup> We must
    therefore be on our

    dangerous to do so before we have finished what we have begun. Let us,
    therefore, retrace our steps. Our little excursion has served, however, to
    acquaint us with at least the existence of those other problems, which we

        [Pareto, following Bentham, invariably uses the word "actions" (<i>azioni</i>)
        where ordinary English parlance uses "conduct" or "behaviour." Such phrases
        as "logical actions" and "non-logical actions" often lead to syntactical and
        other paradoxes in Pareto's text that have contributed not a little to his
        occasional obscurity. For mere convenience <i>azioni</i> is rendered here by
        "conduct," "behaviour," "acts," "actions," more or less interchangeably. The
        literally-minded reader can always recover the feel of the original Italian
        by understanding those words as "actions" with constructions in the plural.
        More troublesome still to the translator is Pareto's use of the phrase
        "non-logical actions" for "the sentiments (or "impulses" or "residues")
        underlying non-logical actions," or for "the principles of non-logical
        actions." There is no extricating him from that situation, and in it as a
        rule I leave him.&mdash;A. L.]

        <i>Histoire des insectes</i>, Vol. I, p. 71. But there is something else.
        Fabre made interesting observations of these insects and others of the kind.
        He succeeded in determining that the number of caterpillars prepared to feed
        the larva varies from five to ten, according as the insect is to be female
        or male. Since the egg is laid after the provisions have been stored, Fabre
        believes that the mother knows beforehand the sex to which the egg is to
        belong (<i>Souvenirs entomologiques</i>, Ser. 2, pp. 72-73). He reverts to the
        matter of the sex of the egg in his third series (pp. 384 f.). Fabre managed
        to discover how the larva of the Eumenis is fed: <i>Ibid.</i>, Ser. 2, pp. 78-79:
        "The egg is not laid on the food: it is hung from the ceiling of the dome by
        a filament rivalling the thread of a spider's web in fineness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
        larva has hatched and is already of some size. Like the egg, it hangs by the
        back from the ceiling of its home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The worm is now at table! Head
        down, he feels about over the soft belly of one of the caterpillars. With a
        wisp of straw I touch the game gently, before it has been bitten. The
        caterpillars begin wriggling, and the larva beats a hasty
        retreat." It crawls back into a sort of sheath: "The covering of the egg is
        its tunnel of refuge. It still keeps its cylindrical form, prolonged a
        little perhaps by the special labours of the new-born larva. At the first
        signs of peril from the pile of caterpillars, the larva draws into its
        sheath and climbs back to the ceiling where the wriggling mob cannot reach
        it." Later on, when the worm has grown stronger and the caterpillars weaker,
        the worm drops to the floor.

        <i>Ibid.</i>, Ser. 1, pp. 67-79. Another truly extraordinary example is
        supplied in Fabre's Ser. 4, pp. 253-54. The Callicurgus hunts a certain
        spider, the Epeiron. The Epeiron "has under his throat two exceedingly sharp
        needles with drops
        of poison on the points. The Callicurgus is lost if the spider pricks him,
        and meantime his operation in anaesthesia requires the unfailing precision
        of the surgeon's knife. What is he to do in a perilous situation that would
        ruin the composure of the coolest human operator? The patient has first to
        be disarmed and then dealt with! And, in fact, there is the stinger of the
        Callicurgus darting forward from the back and driving into the mouth of the
        Epeiron with minutest precautions and untiring persistence! Almost at once
        the poisonous hooks fold up lifeless and the dread prey is powerless to
        harm. The belly of the Hymenopteron then stretches its bow and drives the
        stinger home just behind the fourth pair of legs, on the median line, almost
        at the juncture of belly and cephalo-thorax.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        The nerve ganglia
        controlling the movements of the legs are located a little higher than the
        point pricked, but the backward-forward thrust enables the weapon to reach
        them. This second stroke paralyzes the eight legs all at
        once.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. First,
        to safeguard the operator, a prick in the mouth, a point terrifyingly armed
        and to be dreaded more than all else! Then, to safeguard the offspring, a
        second thrust into the nervous centres of the thorax, to end all movement!"

        Albert Dauzat well says, <i>La langue française d'aujourd'hui</i>, pp.
        238-39: "The whole field is today under the dominion of a principle that
        holds the allegiance of the vast majority of philologists, namely, that
        linguistic phenomena are unconscious. [Another way of expressing what we
        mean by "non-logical actions."] Almost universally accepted in the domain of
        phonology&mdash;transformations in sounds have long since ceased to be
        ascribed to individual caprice&mdash;the principle is nevertheless meeting
        the same opposition in the field of semantics that [phonetic] laws were
        generally arousing not so long ago. M. Bréal [<i>Essai de sémantique</i>, p. 311;
        Cust, pp. 279-81] assigns a very definite role to individual volition in the
        evolution of word-meanings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        This [Bréal's] theory, which would have
        found practically no adversaries fifty years ago, is today rejected with
        virtual unanimity by philologists, who readily subscribe to the axiom stated
        by V. Henry [<i>Antinomies linguistiques</i>, p. 78] that 'any explanation of a
        linguistic phenomenon which to any extent whatever assumes exercise of
        conscious activity on the part of a speaking subject must be <i>a priori</i>
        discarded and held null and void.' " But that is an exaggeration. Scientific
        terminology is nearly always a product of conscious activity, and some few
        terms in ordinary language may have similar origins. On the other hand,
        Bréal's objection does not disturb the fact that a large number of phenomena
        are conscious only in appearances, the activity of the subject resolving
        itself into nonlogical behaviour of our varieties 2 and especially 4.
        Darmesteter, <i>La vie des mots</i>, pp. 86, 133: "In all such changes [in the
        meanings of words] one finds, at bottom, two concurrent intellectual
        elements, the one principal, the other secondary. In the long run, as the
        result of an unconscious detour, the mind loses sight of the first and
        thinks only of the second.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        So the mind passes from one idea to quite
        another under cover of one same physiological fact&mdash;the word. Now this
        unconscious development, which shifts the stress from the principal detail
        to the secondary, is the law, no less, of transformadons in the mental
        world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        So in spite of the family relationships that developments in a
        language may establish between words, words most often lead lives of their
        own and follow their respective destinies all by themselves. When human
        beings speak, they are by no means 'doing etymology.' " Nothing could be
        truer; and that is why people often go astray in trying to infer the meaning
        of a word from its etymology or, what is worse, trying to reconstruct the
        unknown history of a remote past on an etymological basis.

        In Greece and Rome also conduct was largely governed by oracles,
        presages, and the like. In course of time many such practices became purely
        formal. Cicero, <i>De divinatione</i>, I, 16, 28: "In olden times hardly any
        business of importance, even of a private nature, was transacted without
        consulting omens, as witness the 'nuptial auspices' even of our day, which
        have lost their old substance and preserve just the name (<i>re omissa nomen
          tantum tenent</i>). Nowadays auspices on important occasions are obtained,
        though somewhat less generally than was once the case, by inspections of
        entrails. In the old days they were commonly sought of birds."

        They still endure among half-civilized peoples, such as the Chinese,
        and they have not disappeared even in our western countries. Matignon,
        <i>Superstition, crime et misère en Chine</i>, pp. 4-8, 18-19:
        "Superstition, as I
        am about to describe it, has nothing to do with religion." Going on,
        Matignon explains the mysterious entity that the Chinese call <i>fong-choué</i>,
        literally, "wind-and-water": "One might in a general way regard it as a sort
        of topographical superstition. For the Chinese, any given point in the
        Middle Empire is a centre of forces, of spiritual influences, as to the
        nature of which they have very vague and ill-defined ideas, and which no one
        understands, but which are all the more respected and feared on that
        account. [Matignon then tries to explain the facts by the beliefs. He does
        not succeed, because the facts are not consequences of the beliefs (logical
        actions), but the beliefs consequences of the facts (non-logical actions)].
        The <i>fong-choué</i>, accordingly, seems to be something vague, mysterious,
        obscure, difficult, not to say impossible, of interpretation [As was the
        case with divination in Greece and Rome]. And nevertheless, in Chinese eyes,
        that body of fiction becomes science. [Is, in other words, a logical veneer
        sprinkled lavishly over their non-logical conduct. As regards funerals:] the
        astrologer must have fixed on a propitious day and especially by long and
        sagacious investigation, have gone into all aspects of the engrossing
        problem of the <i>fong-choué</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        In building a house, the Chinaman must not
        only consider the <i>fong-choué</i> of his neighbours,
        but also of his own house. A
        millstone, a well, the junction of two walls or two streets, must not be on a
        line with the main entrance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That is not all.
        The <i>fong-choué</i> may be
        satisfied with the site and alignment of a building; but how about the use
        to which it is to be put? <i>X</i> builds a house for a rice-shop.
        But it develops
        that the <i>fong-choué</i> was inclined to favour a tea-shop.
        There is no further
        doubt. <i>X</i> and his rice business will soon be
        in the hands of the receiver.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        The <i>fong-choué</i> superstition is exceedingly tenacious
        [Merely because it is
        an expression of the psychic state <i>A</i> of the Chinese, and nothing else]. It
        is the one that holds out longest against Christianity. And then again, what
        Chinaman, even though considered a good Christian, has altogether abandoned
        his <i>fong-choué</i>?" The situation is a general one.

        Marquardt, <i>Römische Staatsverwaltung: Sacralwesen</i>, pp. 12-19, gives a
        list of these gods. It must be very incomplete, for we may reasonably assume
        that large numbers of names have failed to come down to us. For some of the
        gods in question see our § <a href="#section-1339">1339</a>.
        Just a sample here, pp. 12-13: "Potina and
        Educa, who teach the child to eat and drink; Cuba, who protects the child
        while it is being carried from cradle to bed; Ossipago, 'who hardens and
        strengthens the bones of little children'; Carna, who strengthens the
        muscles; Levana, 'who lifts the child from the floor'; Statanus, Statilinus,
        and the goddess Statina, who teach the child to stand upright; Abeona and
        Adeona, who hold him up when he first tries to walk; Farimus and Fabulinus,
        who help him to talk." Marquardt goes on to list the divinities protecting
        adolescence, matrimony, and other various circumstances of life, and he
        adds, p. 15: "The business of the gods just listed was to protect persons;
        but there was a whole series of other gods who watched over the manifold
        activities of men and the scenes of such activities." Marquardt is mistaken
        in asserting, p. 18, that "originally at least, as Ambrosch has shown [<i>Ueber
          die Religionsbücher der Römer, rem.</i> 121], the thousands of names registered
        in the <i>indigitamenta</i> [ritual catalogues and calendars] were mere
        designations for the various functions (<i>potestates</i>) of relatively few
        divinities." That is the old abstraction idea. The proofs adduced for it are
        inadequate. They are stated by Marquardt as follows, pp. 18-19: "1.
        <i>Indigitare</i> meant to offer a prayer to one or more divinities,
        not in general
        terms but with specific reference to the divine capacities of which help was
        asked. The god was addressed several times, each time one attribute or
        another being added to his name." The various attributes mentioned
        corresponded at times to a number of gods who had been fused into a single
        personality. At other times they may have been different aspects of the same
        god. But that does not prove that Potina, Educa, Cuba, and so on, were
        abstract capacities of one same divine person. "2. In the second place,
        pontifical law forbade offering one victim to two gods at the same time." M.
        Brissaud, Marquardt's French translator, himself shows that that argument is
        baseless, <i>Le culte chez les Romains</i>, Vol. I, p. 24: "There has been no doubt
        either that some of the names listed were surnames of well-known gods." The
        fact that some gods had surnames does not prove that all the names
        catalogued in the <i>indigitamenta</i> were surnames, and much less, as Marquardt
        suggests in a note, p. 18, that they "represented the various attributes of
        divine Providence." Otherwise one would have to conclude that the various
        surnames of the Roman Emperors represented various attributes of a single
        personality.

        <i>Historia naturalis</i>, II, 5, 3 (7) (Bostock-Riley, Vol. I, p. 21):
        "Wherefore the population of celestials can be seen to be greater than the
        population of mortals, since individuals make gods for themselves, each one
        his own (<i>totidem</i>), adopting Junos and genii; and peoples [abroad] take
        certain animals as gods, and even obscene things and things that it is not

        We cannot accept what Marquardt says, <i>Op. cit.,</i> pp. 6-7: "The gods of
        the Romans were mere abstractions. In them they worshipped those forces of
        nature to which the human being feels himself at all times subject, but
        which he can manage to control by scrupulous observance of the altogether
        external prescriptions laid down by the state for honouring the gods." The
        terms have to be inverted. To assure success in their undertakings the
        Romans meticulously observed certain rules which, spontaneous at first,
        eventually came to be used by the state. When, in course of time, people
        wondered how the rules arose, they imagined they saw forces of nature
        worshipped in them. Marquardt himself, for that matter, stresses the
        preponderant importance of the material acts and the scant importance of the
        abstractions, p. 7: "Religious practice required material paraphernalia of
        the simplest sort; but the rites themselves bristled with difficulties and
        complications. The slightest irregularity in a ceremony deprived it of all
        effectiveness."

        Antoine, <i>Syntaxe de la langue latine</i>, p. 125: "The capacity for using
        adjectives substantively is much more restricted in Latin than in Greek and
        even than
        in French. Latin avoids the substantive even when it is available and tends
        to replace it with a paraphrase; for example, 'hearers': <i>animi eoriun qui
          audiunt</i>; instead of <i>auditorum</i>. For the adjective to be turned into a
        substantive, it must result distinctly from the arrangement of the words in
        a sentence and from the sentence as a whole that the adjective designates
        not the quality, but a definite person or thing possessing the quality."
        That is the exact opposite of the process which is alleged to have taken
        place in the little gods considered as qualifying abstractions.
        Riemann-Goelzer, <i>Grammaire comparée du grec et du latin</i>, p. 741, note: "In
        the beginning the adjective was not distinct from the
        substantive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
        substantive derived from the adjective: before coming to substance, people
        first saw an object only in its modes, in its apparent and striking
        attributes: a <i>ζῷον</i> was a 'living thing,'
        an <i>animal</i> was a 'thing endowed with
        life.' Only at a comparatively late date, in an advanced state of
        civilization when the mind had become capable of conceiving of the object
        independently of its attributes, were substantives distinguished from
        adjectives." We cannot, therefore, assume the contrary: namely, that
        abstract beings, such as Providence, were first conceived, and that the
        modes whereby they manifested themselves were imagined later. Observation
        shows that people went from modes to beings&mdash;beings most often
        imaginary.

        <i>De civitate Dei</i>, VI, 9: "If a man assigned two nurses to a child, the
        one just for giving him his food, the other his drink, the way two goddesses
        Educa and Potina were appointed to those offices, would we not say that he
        was mad and that in his own house he was acting like a clown? Some maintain
        that Liber is derived from <i>liberare: quod mares in coëundo per eius
          beneficium emissis seminibus liberentur;</i> and that Libera, whom they also say
        is Venus, performs the same service for women: <i>quod et ipsas perhibeant
          semina emittere</i>, and therefore the same male organ is set up in the temples
        to Liber, and the female likewise to
        Libera.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When the male unites with
        the female, the god Jugatinus presides. Be it so. But the bride has to be
        taken to the groom's house, and that is the business of the god Domiducus.
        There is the god Domitius to see that she stays there; and the goddess
        Maturna that she abide with her husband. What more is needed? Mercy, I pray,
        on decency! Let concupiscence of flesh and blood do the rest under the
        secret tutelage of modesty! Why crowd the bedchamber with a throng of gods,
        when even the 'best men' [paranymphs] have seen fit to withdraw? And yet it
        is so filled not that the thought of their presence may inspire higher
        regard for chastity, but to the end that through their concert the maiden,
        afraid as befits the weakness of her sex of what is in store, may be
        deprived of her maidenhood without mishap. And that is why the goddess
        Verginensis is there, and the father-god Subigo, and the mother-goddess
        Prema, and the goddess Pertunda, and Venus, and Priapus. And why all that?
        If the groom needed the help of the gods in everything he did, would not one
        of the gods or one of the goddesses be enough? Was not Venus enough all by
        herself? She was already there, summoned, they say, because without her
        influence a
        maid cannot cease to be a maid.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        And, forsooth, if the goddess
        Verginensis is there that the maid's girdle be loosed; if the god Subigo is
        there <i>ut viro subigatur</i>; if the goddess Prema is there,
        <i>ut subacta ne se
          commoveat comprimatur</i>&mdash;what, pray, is the goddess Pertunda doing
        there? Shame on her! Out with her! Let the groom do something himself, I
        say! <i>Valde inhonestum est ut quod vocatur ilia</i> (the thing that takes the
        name from her) <i>impleat qnisqiiam nisi ille</i>! But that is perhaps tolerated
        because she is said to be a goddess not a god. For if the deity were
        believed a male and called Pertundus, out of respect for his bride the groom
        would cry for help against him in louder voice than woman in childbirth
        against Sylvanus. <i>Sed quid hoc dicam, cum ibi sit et Priapus nimius
          masculuss, super cuius immanissimum et turpissimum fascinum sedere nova
          nupta iubebatur more honestissimo et religiosissimo matronarum?</i>" St.
        Augustine is right, with plenty to spare, if such acts are to be judged from
        the logical standpoint; but he does not observe that they were originally
        nonlogical acts, mechanical formalities, which eventually found their place
        among ceremonies of divine worship.

        The idea is not altogether hypothetical. That blessed weed has a whole
        literature all its own! Eustathius, <i>Commentarii ad Homeri Odysseam</i>, Vol. I,
        p. 381, offers us our choice between two interpretations. The one is
        mythological. The giant Pikolous, in flight after his battle with Zeus,
        landed on Circe's island and attacked her. The Sun rushed to the rescue of
        his daughter and slew the giant. From the blood that was spilled on the
        ground there sprouted a plant which was named <i>μῶλν</i> after the terrible fight
        (<i>μῶλος</i>) the giant had offered. The blossom is milk-white because of the
        bright sun; and the root black because the giant's blood was black, or
        because of Circe's terror. Hephestion tells more or less the same story.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that interpretation is not to your liking, Eustathius has another
        ready&mdash;allegorical,
        this time [<i>Op. cit., loc. cit.</i>]: <i>μῶλν</i> is education; the root is
        black, to symbolize ignorance; the flowers milk-white, to symbolize the
        splendours of knowledge. The plant is difficult to pull up because learning
        is an arduous achievement. Now all we need is that some pupil of Max Müller
        shall bob up and tell us that that plant with the black root and the white
        blossoms, which mortals are unable to pull up, and which has beneficent
        effects, is the Sun, which rises from the darkness of the night, is
        brilliantly luminous, cannot be disturbed by any human act, and gives life
        to the earth.

        Pliny, <i>Historia naturalis</i>, XXV, 8 (4) (Bostock-Riley, Vol. V, pp. 87-88):
        "Most celebrated of plants, according to Homer, is the one that he believes
        was named moly [<i>Allium magicum</i>, "witch-garlic," according to Littré, in the
        notes to his translation of Pliny] by the gods themselves, the discovery of
        which he credits to Mercury and which he represents as efficacious against
        deadly poisons [Bostock-Riley: "Against the most potent spells of sorcery"].
        It is said that a plant of that name still grows today about Lake Pheneus
        and at Cyllene in Arcady. It is like the plant mentioned by Homer. It has a
        round black root, about the size of an onion, with leaves like the squill.
        It is hard to pull up. [Bostock-Riley: "There is no difficulty experienced
        in taking it up"]. Greek writers say its blossom is yellow, but Homer
        describes it as pure white. I once met a physician whose hobby was botany,
        and he told me that the 'moly' also grew in Italy; and some few days later
        he brought me a specimen from Campania that he had pulled up with great
        difficulty from a rocky soil. The root was thirty feet long; and that was
        not the whole of it, for it had broken off." Theophrastus, <i>Historia
          plantarum,</i> IX, 15, 7 (Hort, Vol. II, pp. 294-95): "The <i>moly</i> is found at
        Pheneus and in the Cyllene region. They also say that it is like the plant
        Homer mentions. It has a round root, like an onion. The leaves are like the
        squill. It is used as an antidote and in magic rites. It is not as hard to
        pull up as Homer says." All of these writers take Homer's <i>μῶλν</i> for a
        real plant. [Littré's note identifying the moly as "witch-garlic" is not his
        own but derives from Antoine Laurent Fée, biographer of Linnaeus, who edited
        Pliny's botany for the French translation of Pliny that was published in
        1826 by François Étienne Ajasson de Grandsagne.&mdash;A. L.]

        In the Middle Ages the mandrake enjoyed a very considerable prestige.
        Mercury has vanished, but Satan is on hand to replace him. O'Reilly, <i>Les
          deux procès de condamnation de Jeanne d'Arc</i>, Vol. II, pp. 164-65: "Jeanne
        was in the habit of carrying a mandrake on her person, hoping thereby to
        procure fortune and riches in this world. She believed, in fact, that the
        mandrake had the virtue of bringing good fortune. <i>Q</i>. What have you to say
        [about the charge] as to the mandrake? <i>A</i>. That is false, absolutely.
        (Abstract of examinations relative to Charge 7):
        Thursday, March 1. Questioned as to what she did with her mandrake, she answered
        that she had never had one, that she had heard that there was one near her
        house, without having seen it. It was, she had been told, a dangerous and
        wicked thing to keep. She did not know what it might be used for. Questioned

        Text: <i>"Praeterea alia sunt verba impetritis, alia depulsoriis, alia
          commentationis</i> [<i>commentationis for commendationis</i>]."
        <i>Impetritum</i> is a
        technical term of augury and designates a request made of the gods according
        to ritual. Cicero, <i>De divinatione</i>, II, 15, 35: "How comes it that a person
        desiring to ask an omen of the gods (<i>impetrire</i>) sacrifices a victim
        appropriate to his need (<i>rebus suis</i>)?" Valerius Maximus, <i>De dictis
          factisque memorabilibus</i>, I, 1, 1: "Our forefathers provided that fixed and
        solemn ceremonies should be entrusted (<i>explicari voluerunt</i>) to the
        learning of pontiffs, assurances of success (<i>bene gerendarum rerum
          auctoritates</i>)
        to the observation of augurs, prophecy to the books of the soothsayers of
        Apollo, and exorcisms of unfavourable omens (<i>portentorum depulsiones</i>) to
        the lore of the Etruscans. By ancient custom, divine influences are invoked,
        in case of a commendation through a prayer; when something is requested,
        through a vow; when a favour is to be paid for, by a thanksgiving
        (<i>gratidatione</i>); when information is sought either of entrails or of lots,
        through a petition (<i>impetrito</i>, that is, by an observation of omens); when a
        solemn rite is called for (<i>cum solemni ritu peragendum</i>) by a sacrifice,
        wherewith also the significance of portents and lightning bolts is carefully
        observed."

        Such data are abundant. For example, Thiers, <i>Traité des superstitions</i>,
        I, 6, 2 (Avignon, Vol. I, p. 415; Amsterdam, Vol. I, p. 101): "To stop a
        snake by the following conjuration (Mizauld, <i>Centuriae</i>, II, no. 93): 'I
        abjure thee by Him who created thee to stop, and if thou dost not, I curse
        thee with the curse whereby the Lord God did exterminate thee.' " It is
        evident that the basic fact in the situation is the feeling that it is
        possible to act on certain animals by means of certain definite words
        (element <i>a</i> in § <a href="#section-0798">798</a>);
        the secondary fact is in the words themselves (element
        <i>b</i> in § <a href="#section-0798">798</a>).
        The basic fact belongs to a very populous class of facts
        comprising the sentiments which induce human beings to believe that things
        can be influenced by means of words
        (genus I-<i>y</i> of § <a href="#section-0888">888</a>). It is interesting
        that though Thiers considers certain superstitions absurd, he does not think
        of them all that way (Avignon, Vol. I, Preface, pp. viii-ix [Amsterdam, Vol.
        I, p. ii, publisher's note <i>Au lecteur</i>, quoting Thiers to the same general
        effect]): "I have quoted superstitions entire when I felt that there could
        be no harm in doing so and when it seemed in a way necessary not to
        abbreviate them if they were to be correctly understood. But I have often
        used dots and <i>etc.'s</i> for certain words, letters, signs, and other things,
        with which they have to be equipped in order to produce the effects desired
        of them, because I was afraid of inspiring evil in my effort to combat it."

        Cicero, <i>De divinatione</i>, I, 45, 102: "The Pythagoreans noted the words
        not only of gods but also of men, calling such things 'omens.' And our
        forefathers thought words very important, and began everything they did by
        uttering the formula 'May it be good, fortunate, propitious, successful.' At
        ceremonies conducted in public there was always the request for silence
        (<i>faverent linguis</i>), and proclamations of religious festivals contained an
        injunction of abstinence from quarrels and brawls. When a colony was
        receiving the lustration from its head, an army from its general, the People
        from the Censor, the individuals who led the victims to sacrifice had to
        have auspicious names; and so in enlisting men for the army the consuls made
        sure that the first soldier taken had a good name."

        Samples of the kind are available for all peoples and in any quantity
        desired&mdash;one has only the embarrassment of choice. The charms imparted
        by Cato seem to have nothing whatever to do with gods: they function all by
        themselves. <i>De re rustica</i>, 160:
        "In cases of sprain, a cure may be obtained
        by the following charm. Take a green stick four or five feet long. Split it
        in two down the middle, and have two men hold [the two pieces] at [your]
        hips. Then begin to chant: <i>In alio s.f. motas vaeta daries dardaries
          astataries dissunapiter,</i> and keep on till ["the free ends" (Harrison)] come
        together [in front of you]. Brandish a knife (<i>ferrum</i>) in the air over
        them. Take them in your hand at the point where they touch on coming
        together and cut them off, right and left. Bind [the pieces] to the sprain
        or fracture and it will heal." Pliny mentions this magic formula given by
        Cato and adds others; <i>Historia naturalis</i>, XXVIII, 4 (2)
        (Bostock-Riley, Vol. V, p. 283):
        "Cato has handed down to us a magic cure for sprained limbs, and
        M. Varro one for gout. They say that Caesar, the dictator, after a serious
        accident in a carriage, was accustomed, before taking his seat in one, to
        repeat a rigmarole three times to make sure of a safe ride, and we know that

        Lucian, <i>Philopseudes</i> (Lover of Lies), 14-15 (Harmon, Vol. III, p.
        343). A hyperborean magician summons a certain Chrysis to do the pleasure of
        her admirer, Glaucias. " 'At length the hyperborean moulded a clay Eros, and
        ordered it to go and fetch Chrysis. Off went the image, and before long
        there was a knock at the door, and there stood Chrysis! She came in and
        threw her arms about Glaucias's neck. You would have said she was dying for
        love of him; and she stayed
        on till at last we heard the cocks crowing. Away flew the Moon to Heaven,
        Hecate disappeared underground, all the apparitions vanished, and we saw
        Chrysis out of the house just about dawn.&mdash;Now, Tychiades, if you had
        seen that, it would have been enough to convince you that there was
        something in incantations.' 'Exactly,' I replied. 'If I had seen it, I
        should have been convinced: as it is, you must bear with me if I have not
        your eyes for the miraculous. But as to Chrysis, I know her for a most
        inflammable [and not very fastidious] lady. I do not see what occasion there
        was for the clay ambassador, and the Moon, no less, or for a wizard all the
        way from the land of the hyperboreans! Why, Chrysis would go that distance
        herself for the sum of twenty shillings. It is a form of incantation that
        she cannot resist. She is the exact opposite of an apparition. Apparitions,
        you tell me, take flight at the clash of brass or iron, whereas if Chrysis
        hears the chink of silver, she flies to the spot.' " (Fowler translation.)

        Clement mentions other cases also. The land of Greece suffering from a
        great drought, the Pythoness prescribed that the people should resort to
        prayers by Aeacus. Aeacus went up on a mountain and prayed, and soon it
        rained copiously. For the same incident, see Pindar's scholiast, <i>Nemea</i>, V,
        17 (Abel, Vol. II, p. 155); Diodorus Siculus,
        <i>Bibliotheca historica</i>, IV, 61,

        In the same connexion Clement recalls that Samuel also made it rain (I Kings,
        12:18). Going back to the Greeks, Clement relates how at Chios Aristeus
        obtained winds from Jove to temper the heat of the dog-days; and that fact
        is also vouched for by Hyginus, <i>Poeticon astronomicon</i>, II, 4, 5 (Chatelain,
        p. 17). Clement does not forget that at the time of the Persian invasion the
        Pythoness advised the Greeks to placate the winds (Herodotus, <i>Historiae</i>.
        VII, 178). Then comes the story of Empedocles; and Clement is back with his
        Bible again, quoting Ps., 83; Deut. 10:16, 17; Isa. 40:26. Then he remarks:
        "Some say that pestilences, hail-storms, wind-squalls, and other similar
        calamities are caused not only by natural perturbations, but also by certain
        demons, or by the wrath of wicked angels." He continues with the story of
        the officials appointed at Cleonae to prevent hail-storms, and discusses the
        sacrifices used for that purpose (§ <a href="#section-0194">194</a>).
        Then he tells about the
        purification of Athens by Epimenides and mendons other similar stories.

        British sea off the shores of Brittany (<i>Osismicis adversa litoribus</i>) there
        is a celebrated oracle of a Gallic divinity, where the priestesses are said
        to be nine in number and
        sanctified by perpetual chastity. They are called 'Barrigenae' (variant,
        Gallicenae) and are supposed to be endowed with remarkable abilities to
        raise winds and high seas with their incantations, to turn into any animal
        they choose, cure diseases usually considered incurable, and see and predict
        the future; though they will perform such favours only for mariners who have
        made special voyages for the purpose of consulting them." Reinach deals with
        this text in <i>Cultes, mythes et religions</i>, Vol. I, p. 199,
        <i>Les vierges de Sena.</i>
        He thinks that Mela was repeating information derived from Greek
        traditions: "Whatever Mela's immediate source in what he says of the Isle of
        Sena, there is reason to suppose that the substance of his story is very
        ancient. I believe I detect traces of it in the <i>Odyssey</i> itself, that
        prototype, as Lucian was to say in his time, of all the geographical
        romances of antiquity." That may well be; or it may also be that both the
        stories in the <i>Odyssey</i> and the others had a common origin in the notion that
        it is possible to influence winds, a notion that was variously elaborated
        and explained as time went on.

        primitive peoples of Greece, but that cult, which plays such an important
        part in the Rig-Veda, had noticeably weakened among the Hellenes. The winds

        Herodotus has some doubts also as to the aid lent by Boreas to the
        Athenians. He cautions that he does not know that Boreas really scattered
        the Barbarian fleet in answer to the prayers of the Athenians. He does know
        that the

        so on previous occasions: <i>Historiae,</i> VII, 189: <i>οὶ δ'ὦν Αθηναῖοι

        the chants of Circe (Aeaeaque carmina).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        At her pleasure clouds gather
        over the whole sky, at her pleasure bright day shines forth from the whole
        orb of Heaven." In Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses,</i> VII, v. 201, Medea boasts: "The

        there are peals of thunder that Jove knows nothing of. So with their magic
        words (<i>vocibus</i>) they dispel the canopy of watery vapour and cause the
        tresses of the storm-clouds to vanish. Now the sea lashes wild

        stone, one the jar of rain and the other the jar of the winds. If India is
        suffering from a drought, the one containing the rain is opened, and it
        sends clouds and rains over all the land. If there is too much rain, the jar
        is closed, and the storm ceases. The jar of the winds works, I should say,
        something like the bag of Aeolus. If it is opened, one of the winds gets
        out, and it blows where it is needed and dries the land."

        <i>Marcus Antoninus Philosophus,</i> 24, 4. The case of a storm favouring
        one of two belligerents as a result of magic or by divine goodwill is to be
        noted in countries widely separated and under such conditions as to preclude
        any suspicion of imitation.

        117-18, Davis transcribes a passage from the <i>History of the Three Kingdoms:</i>
        "Lew-pei took occasion to steal upon Chang-paou with his whole force, to
        baffle which the latter mounted his horse, and, with dishevelled hair and
        waving sword, betook himself to magic arts. The wind arose with loud peals
        of thunder, and there descended from on high a black cloud, in which
        appeared innumerable men and horses as if engaged. Lew-pei immediately drew
        off his troops in confusion, and giving up the contest, retreated to consult
        with Choo-tsien. The latter observed, 'Let him have recourse again to magic;
        I will prepare the blood of swine, sheep, and dogs.'&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        On the following
        day, Chang-paou, with flags displayed and drums beating, came forth to offer
        battle, and Lew-pei proceeded to meet him; but scarcely had they joined
        before Chang-paou put his magic in exercise; the wind and thunder arose, and
        a storm of sand and stone commenced. A dark cloud obscured the sky, and
        troops of horsemen seemed to descend. Lew-pei upon this made a show of
        retreating, and Chang-paou followed him; but scarcely had they turned the
        hill when the ambushed troops started up and launched upon the enemy their
        impure stores. The air seemed immediately filled with men and horses of
        paper or straw, which fell to the earth in confusion; while the winds and
        thunder at once ceased, and the sand and stones no longer flew about."

        <i>Apologia,</i> I, 71 (Migne, p. 439A, Davie, p. 55). The Emperor Marcus is
        writing to the Senate, and the forger makes him say of the Christians: "They
        prayed to a god unknown to me, and straightway water fell from the sky and
        to us it was ice-cold, but to the enemies of the Romans it was a hail of
        fire." The miracle grows and grows and gets prettier and prettier! The
        incident and the letter are mentioned by Tertullian, <i>Apologeticus,</i> V, 6;
        and Eusebius, <i>Historia ecclesiastica,</i> V, 1-6. Eusebius does not state that
        the Emperor requested the Christians to pray&mdash;they knelt and prayed of
        their own accord before the battle. The enemy was surprised at the
        spectacle. But a more astounding thing then occurred: a hurricane arose and
        put the enemy to flight, while a gentle rain refreshed the Romans. Zonaras,
        <i>Epitome historiarum,</i> XII, 2 (Migne, Vol. 134, pp. 1003-06), on the other
        hand, repeats by and large the story of the Pseudo-Justin. Orosius,
        <i>Historiae adversas paganos,</i> VII, 15 (Browne, p. 126), says: "The tribes had
        risen in insurrection, barbarous in their cruelties and countless in their
        multitudes, to wit: the Marcomanni, the Quadi, the Vandals, the Sarmatae,
        the Suebi&mdash;in fact almost all Germany. The army having advanced to the
        frontiers of the Quadi, it was there surrounded by the enemy, and found
        itself in imminent danger from thirst, but more in view of a shortage of
        water than because of the foe. Whereupon certain of the soldiers began to
        pray in great earnestness of faith and publicly to call upon the name of
        Christ; and straightway a rain fell in such abundance as to refresh the
        Romans bounteously and with out damage, whereas the Barbarians were terrified
        by a rapid succession of thunderbolts and large numbers of them were killed,
        so that he [Marcus Aurelius] put them to rout." See also Nicephorus Callistus,

        It appears in virtually naked form in the case of the "pluvial stone"
        in Rome, which needed only to be moved about the streets to produce rain.
        Festus, <i>De verborum significatione,</i> I, <i>s.v. Aquaelicium</i> (London,
        Vol. I, p. 84): "[This term] is used when rain-water is attracted by certain
        rites, such as dragging the 'pluvial stone' about the streets of the city as used
        to be done, according to legend, in days gone by." And <i>Ibid.,</i> XI, <i>s.v.
          Manalis lapis</i> "flowing stone" (London, Vol. I p. 383): "The 'flowing
        stone,' so called, was a certain stone that lay outside the Porta Capena
        near the temple of Mars. In times of excessive drought this stone was
        carried about the streets inside the city, whereupon rain at once ensued.
        They called it the flowing stone because the water began flowing." So then,
        all that was required was to drag the stone about the city, and the rain
        came down at once. <i>Cf.</i> Nonius Marcellus, <i>De compendiosa doctrina,</i>
        15, <i>s.v. Trulleum</i> (Mercier, p. 547); Fulgentius, <i>Expositio sermonum
          antiquorum ad Chalcidium grammaticum</i> (Müncker, Vol. II, pp. 169-70): "Labeo,
        who compiled and annotated the Etruscan rituals of the gods Tages and Bacitis,
        writes as follows: 'If the flesh of the liver is of a sandarac red, it is time
        for the flowing stones to be scraped and cleaned (<i>verrere</i>).' He means
        those cylinder-shaped stones which our forefathers used to drag about their
        properties to break a period of dry weather."

        Pausanias, <i>Periegesis,</i> VIII, <i>Arcadia,</i> 38, 4 (Dindorf, pp. 414-15).
        The author is speaking of the spring called Hagnus on Mount Lycaeus: "When a
        drought has lasted for a long time and the sown seed and the trees have
        begun to suffer, the priest of the Lycaean Zeus offers prayers and
        sacrifices to the water according to the established forms and then stirs
        the water in the spring with an oak-branch&mdash;on the surface, not deep
        down. As the water is stirred a mistlike vapour rises. Soon the vapour
        becomes a cloud, and attracting other clouds causes rain to fall on the land
        of the Arcadians." We shall see (§ <a href="#section-0203">203</a>) that
        witches caused rain and hail by somewhat similar means, the differences being
        as follows: 1. The Devil of the Christians takes the place of the pagan
        divinities (each people of course introducing the beings deified in its own
        religion). 2. In Pausanias the operation is primarily beneficent. It may be
        so among Christians; but in general it is a wicked thing. (Deified beings

        Devil is by nature wicked.) In the present case we see an imaginary fact
        explained in various ways. The sentiments corresponding to the fact are
        evidently the constant element, the explanations the variable element.

        <i>Stromata,</i> VI, 3 (<i>Opera,</i> Vol. II, p. 247B; Wilson, Vol. II, pp.
        319-23). The Dominican Inquisitors, Sprenger and Kramer, who wrote the
        <i>Malleus maleficarum,</i> debate learnedly and at length as to whether the Devil
        must always work with the magician, or whether they can function separately.
        <i>Pars</i> I, <i>quaestio</i> 2 (Summers, p. 12): "Whether it is sound doctrine
        to hold that the Devil must always co-operate with the sorcerer in an act of
        witchcraft, or whether the one can produce that effect without the other, as
        the Devil without the sorcerer, or <i>vice versa."</i> As proof that the human
        being could do without the Devil or, in general terms, the "lower" without
        the "higher" power, some cited the fact vouched for by Albertus Magnus that
        sage-leaves when rotted in a certain manner and thrown into a well [Summers,
        "running water"] could bring on a storm. The <i>Malleus</i> has no doubts on the
        point, but explains it. It begins by distinguishing different effects, such
        as <i>ministeriales, noxiales, maleficiales, et naturales</i> [Summers, p. 14:
        "beneficial, hurtful, wrought by witchcraft, natural"]. The first are
        produced by good angels, the second by
        wicked angels, the third by the Devil with the help of sorcerers or witches,
        the last by influences from celestial bodies. That much clear, it is easy to
        see how the sage has the effects it has without the help of the Devil
        [Summers, p. 16]: "And thirdly, as to the sage that has been rotted and
        thrown into a well, it is to be said that a 'noxial' effect can ensue
        without the participation of the Devil but not apart from the influence of a
        celestial body."

        St. Gregory of Tours, <i>De sancto Nicetio Treverorum episcopo,</i> 5
        (<i>Vitae Patrum,</i> XVII, <i>Opera,</i> p. 1083B),
        tells of an incident that happened to St.
        Nizier. One day a man called on the Saint to thank him for having saved his
        life at sea under very perilous circumstances, in the following terms: "A
        short time since, while in a ship on my way to Italy, I found myself amid a
        multitude of heathen, and in that great throng of uncouth individuals I was
        the only Christian. One day a tempest arose and I began to call on the name
        of God that by His intercession He should cause the tempest to abate. The
        heathen for their part were praying to their own gods, some beseeching Jove,
        some calling on Mercury, in loud voice, others begging help now of Minerva,
        now of Venus. Since we were in grave peril of death, I said to them:
        'Gentlemen, pray not to those gods, for they are not gods but devils. If ye
        would save yourselves from this present perdition, call upon St. Nizier, that
        he secure you salvation of the mercy of God.' Whereupon with one loud voice
        they cried, 'God of Nizier, save us!' and straightway the sea subsided, the
        winds abated, the sun came out, and the ship sailed on whither we were
        bound."

        The witches' sabbath is declared a fraud:
        "Wheretore the priests through the Churches entrusted to them shall preach
        to God's people in all urgency that they should know that all such things
        are altogether false and that
        such phantoms are inflicted upon the minds of the faithful not by a divine
        but by an evil spirit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For who of us is not carried
        outside himself in
        dreams and nocturnal visions and does not see in his sleep things never seen
        while waking? And who could be so stupid and so weak of mind as to think
        that all such things which take place only in the spirit take place in the
        body also?" The decree was taken from Reginon, <i>De disciplinis ecclesiasticis
          et religione Christiana,</i> II, 364 (<i>Opera,</i> p. 352).
        It is possibly a fragment
        of a capitulary of Charles the Bald. Baronio, <i>Annales ecclesiastici, anno</i>
        382, XX, quotes a decree of Pope Damasus: "Likewise to be excommunicated are
        all such as attend to spells, auguries, fortunetelling and all other
        superstitions; and under the same condemnation are especially to be punished
        women who by the Devil's deception imagine they are carried about at night
        on the backs of animals and go travelling in company with Herodias."

        Eunapius relates, <i>Vitae philosophorum ac sophistarum, Aedisius,
          Sopater,</i> Wright, pp. 383-85, that one year it came to pass that, favourable
        winds failing, ships could not get to Byzantium with their grain. The
        famished inhabitants were being entertained in a theatre with scant success
        and loudly protested to the Emperor Constantine that the philosopher Sopater
        was the cause of the famine, since "he had shackled the winds with his
        transcendent science." Constantine was convinced, and ordered the man
        executed. Suidas, <i>Lexicon, s.v. Σώπατρος Άπαμεύς</i>, says that the
        philosopher in question was killed by Constantune "so as to make evident to
        all that he, Constantine, was no longer a devotee of the Hellenic religion."
        This version accords with the other, Suidas explaining the "convinced" of
        Eunapius! <i>Codex Theodosianus,</i> IX, 16, 5 (Haenel, p. 869):
        "Many individuals do not hesitate to disturb the elements by art of magic
        nor to upset the tranquillity (<i>vitas</i>) of
        innocent citizens and annoy them by fatuous talk (<i>ventilare</i>) about
        evoking ghosts of the dead (<i>manibus accitis</i>), on pretence that they can
        overcome their enemies by witchcraft. Since such individuals are unnatural
        monsters (<i>naturae peregrini</i>), may a deadly pest destroy them."
        The same law appears in the <i>Codex Justiniani,</i> IX, 18, 6
        (<i>Corpus iuris civilis,</i> Vol. II, p. 596; Scott, Vol. XV, p. 33).
        And <i>cf. Codex legis Wisigothorum,</i> VI, 2, 3
        (Canciani, Vol. IV, p. 133): "Sorcerers and storm-compellers who are said to
        bring hail upon vineyards and grain-fields by certain incantations, and
        those who disturb the minds of people by conjuring up devils, wheresoever
        discovered and arrested by a magistrate or by a local representative or
        attorney [of the Crown] shall be publicly lashed with two hundred lashes,
        and with their hair clipped in derision they shall be forced, if
        unconsenting, to march around the ten estates next adjoining, that others
        may profit by their example." <i>Capitulare seculare anni 805: De incantoribus

        and individuals who cause storms or practise other witchcraft, it is the

        upbraiding." One of these wicked demons, who was possessing a maiden, was
        exorcized on relics of St. Marcellinus and St. Peter, and gave a clear
        explanation of the trouble: "I am," he said, "a satellite and disciple of

        all. The devastation was, he said, "due to the wickedness of this people and
        the many iniquities of its rulers." And, the tongue falling where the tooth
        scratched, he did not forget the tithes: <i>"Rari sunt qui fid<i>élite</i>r ac devote

        <i>"Tunc pater puellam per manum ad torrentem deduxit. 'Fac,' inquit,

        The other example reported by Del Rio is a story taken from Pontano, of a
        city besieged by the King of Naples, which ran short of water and obtained
        it by rains provoked by magic and sacrilege. Del Rio may have had before him
        other passages from the <i>Formicarius</i> or the <i>Malleus:</i>
        for example, as regards the latter, the incident recounted in
        <i>Pars</i> II, <i>quaestio</i> I, <i>cap.</i> III
        (Summers, pp. 104, 107): "As to the manner in which they [witches] are
        transferred physically from one place to another." A witch had not been
        invited to a wedding banquet. "Enraged and thinking to avenge herself, she
        conjured up the Devil, stated her grievance and asked him to be good enough
        to make a hail-storm and scatter the company at the dance. Consenting, he
        lifted her up and in full view of certain shepherds bore her through the air
        to [the top of] a hill near the town. As she afterwards confessed, there was
        no water there for pouring into her pit&mdash;a way they have, as will be
        seen, when they are getting hail. So she made a little hole and filled it
        with her urine in place of water, and stirred it with her finger, as her
        custom was, the Devil looking on. And straightway the Devil, raising the
        liquid high in the air, sent a violent storm with hail-stones, just upon the
        party at the dance and the people in the town. The guests were scattered.
        They were still talking together as to the cause of what had happened when
        the witch came home. That aroused their suspicions. But when the shepherds
        told what they had seen, the suspicion which had been strong became violent.
        [We laugh nowadays at such idiocy; but the sentiments it expresses have been
        the cause of untold sufferings to mankind, and countless deaths.] The woman
        was arrested and confessed that she had done those things for
        cause&mdash;probably because she had not been invited to the party. Then she
        was burned, in view also of many other acts of witchcraft [Probably as well
        authenticated as the above!] of which she had been guilty." Del Rio got this
        story from the <i>Daemonolatreia</i> of Remy, I, 25
        (Lyons, pp. 158-62; Ashwin, pp. 74-75).

        sorcerers can abate
        tempests, cause lightning and thunder, provoke hail-storms and rain-storms
        and like weather, and they can send them upon such lands as they choose." He
        rebukes people who do not believe such things and claim that only God can do
        them: "To be sure, God does do them as the prime, independent, universal
        efficient-cause; but his creatures do them as particular, dependent, and
        secondary efficient-causes. Wherefore the common opinion of theologians and
        jurists, which I stated as my thesis, is to be followed. It is proved,
        firstly, by Most Holy Scripture: for there Satan causes fire to fall from
        Heaven and destroy the servants and the flocks of Job; and he also causes
        violent winds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        Most Holy Scripture expressly states that the hail
        whereby the Egyptians were punished was sent by wicked
        angels.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why,
        finally, are the demons so many times called by the Apostle 'princes of the
        air'? Far rather because of their great power over the air! The same is
        confirmed [secondly] not only by
        the ancient Law of the XII Tables&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        but by the decrees of Emperors and
        Popes. It is confirmed [thirdly] by all those Fathers whom I have
        quoted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        And fourthly, it is proved by history and by examples. Herodotus bears
        witness to the abating of winds and a storm by magicians at the time of
        Xerxes. [Not a word about the qualifying remarks of Herodotus
        (§ <a href="#section-0193">193</a>).]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        Of the Finns and Lapps Olaus [Magnus] writes as follows [<i>Historia de
          gentibus septentrionalibus,</i> III, 16, p. 119 (Streater, III, 15, p. 47)]:
        "In olden times they put the winds up for sale to merchants, offering three
        knots on which a spell had been cast: untying the first they [the merchants]
        would get gentle breezes; untying the second, stronger winds, and the third,
        a whole gale.' " Just earlier, II, 9 (Louvain, Vol. I, p. 137; Cologne, p.
        124), Del Rio tells the story of "Eric, King of the Goths, who could get a
        fair wind from any direction in which he turned his fur cap: and for that
        reason he was nicknamed 'Windy-Cap' (<i>Pileus Ventosus</i>)'"
        [Magnus, <i>Ibid.,</i> III,
        15, p. 116; Streater, III, 13, p. 45. In reading these passages in Magnus,
        Streater arbitrarily changes <i>"ventum venalem"</i> to
        <i>"vinum venalem,"</i> which
        gives a different cast to the anecdote, the game with the knots remaining a
        mere trick or curiosity.&mdash;A. L.]

        will of God, whereof in such respects he is the executor, he besets the
        minds of those silly women, and fills them with all sorts of insane ideas,
        and shows them this or that opportunity for getting even with their enemies,
        as by clouding the sky, stirring up tempests, and making it hail." That
        rascal of a Bodin, however, has serious objections to Weier's theory: <i>De la
          démonomanie,</i> p. 235b: "As to what Wier says to the effect that witches
        cannot cause hail or thunder of themselves, I agree, and the same for
        killing people or
        causing them to die by means of wax images and incantations. But what cannot
        be denied, and Wier himself agrees on that score, is that Sathan causes
        people, animals, and crops to die, if God does not keep him from it, and
        that that he does by way of the sacrifices, 'wishes,' and prayers of
        sorcerers, with the just permission of God, who uses His enemies to get even
        with His enemies." Bodin certainly knew a great deal about other people's
        business!

        seems to be somewhat more persuasive force in the fact that these

        that things afterwards take place exactly as they predict. But that too can
        easily be explained on the assumption of illusion, by saying that the Devil,
        in order to give his followers a high opinion of his powers, loves to
        ascribe natural happenings to himself, foresees them, and incites witches to
        produce them; and thereupon they occur, not of his power, much less by the

        Duval, <i>Procès des sorciers à Viry,</i> pp. 88-108:
        "Marguerite [Moral]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        files complaint and criminal action before us, Claude Dupuis, châtelain of
        this barony, in due and proper form, against&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        [names of three women]
        alleging that on the twenty-ninth day of April at noontime, the said
        Marguerite coming from the fields from weeding her beans and being in her
        yard gathering greens, the said defendants came up each carrying a stick of
        wood in hand, and saying such words as 'Deceitful witch, you have got to go
        to Viry'; whereupon they began to beat the said plaintiff on her body with
        all their might and also tied her arms with a rope so that she could not
        move." The defendants are questioned and
        ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. declare that they know nothing,
        that they did in no way beat the said
        Marguerite, and would not have thought of doing so. They confess
        nevertheless that they said and called her a witch to her face, because many
        others so called her and almost everybody who knew her, especially since,
        after the death of the child of Pierre Testu, otherwise known as Grangier,
        the said Marguerite had fled, because people said that she had killed it."
        The trial continues, the châtelain hearing several witnesses. Some of them
        know nothing. Others testify corroborating Marguerite's charge that she had
        been beaten. But the châtelain and his jury are not convinced. And since the
        defendants accused of the assault and battery "have confessed that they said
        and rebuked the said Marguerite that she was a witch, which is a very
        serious charge," they order an investigation by criminal procedure (torture)
        to ascertain what truth there may be in it. So Marguerite the plaintiff
        becomes Marguerite the defendant. Several witnesses are heard. They mention
        a number of children who have died, they allege, because of Marguerite. One
        of them testifies that she had a quarrel with a certain woman named Andrée
        "and a little after one of her children died and also a child of her
        brother, Claude, under mysterious circumstances." In our day, there would
        have been an inquest to determine whether any poison had been administered.
        In those days it was not considered necessary that a material cause of death
        be shown. "Before the said children fell ill, the said Marguerite walked
        into the house of the witness, took a seat in the middle between the cradles
        of the said children, asking the said Andrée if she had a place where she
        could leave certain linen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        The said Andrée refusing, the said
        Marguerite was angry and wroth, and immediately afterwards the said children
        fell ill and died"&mdash;and the witness believed for that reason that they
        had been killed by Marguerite. Other evidence of the same kind is brought
        against Marguerite. One witness avers "that that was her fame and reputation
        in the village of Vers and everywhere where she was known, and that many
        people had said and charged to her face that she was a witch without her
        making any objection or taking any [legal] action."

        Lea, <i>History of the Inquisition,</i> Vol. III, pp. 433-34. Pertile is also
        of the same opinion. <i>Storia del diritto italiano,</i> Vol. V, pp. 447-48:
        "And the Church proceeded mildly, excommunicating practitioners of magic,
        subjecting them to canonical penances.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        Nor did it abandon that system
        even later, when, in the thirteenth century, faith had been weakened by the
        reversion to paganism, and the spread of a neo-Manicheism in the sects of
        the Catharists ["Perfects"] and the Patarins, and older superstitions were
        coming to life again stronger than ever." But at this point the author, a
        man writing in our day, feels called upon to pass judgment on beliefs that
        he terms superstitious: "They were in truth very wicked notions not only
        involving belief in commerce with the Devil, in compacts with him in
        exchange for one's soul, and in powers obtained from him by calling on his
        name, consecrating oneself to him, worshipping him; but also involving
        something much worse&mdash;abuse of most sacred things." What this good soul
        calls "very wicked," others regard as objectively ridiculous and
        subjectively pathological! But such the power of certain sentiments! Here we
        have a man who is not a churchman writing towards the end of the nineteenth
        century, but who seemingly takes pacts with the Devil seriously, and calls
        them "wicked"; whereas many modern theologians are at least very sceptical,
        as witness the
        <i>Dictionnaire encyclopédique de la théologie catholique, s.v.</i>
        Magie (Wetzer, <i>s.v. Zauberei</i>): "The main question&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        is to determine
        whether demons can enter the special service of a human being. That question
        cannot be answered in the negative <i>a priori</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        Then a secondary question
        arises as to the manner in which the relationship of service between demon
        and human being is established. Popular belief answers [both questions] by
        assuming that the Devil can be 'conjured up" and thereby constrained to
        serve the human being. But that commonplace fancy cannot have our
        assent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        The stories that were so readily abused in a day gone by in that
        connexion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        undoubtedly originated in the boastings or in the unhealthy
        imaginations of self-styled possessors of powers, and not one of them
        deserves the slightest credence.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Another view, which was held by many theologians and played a part of some
        importance in the days of the prosecutions for witchcraft, held that the
        human being can strike a compact with the Devil and so bind him to certain
        services. The negotiation of the contract was regarded now as a literal
        objective procedure, now as subjective but no less literal, now as implicit,
        now as explicit. As for the objective reality, the contract may be thought
        of as made either by a person in possession of his right mind or by one in
        the sickly condition of the ecstatic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        As for direct commerce with the Devil&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        the notion is so vulgar that we may be excused from dwelling on
        it longer." The writer of this article recognizes that there may be such a
        compact in the ecstatic condition: "But it is readily apparent that such a
        pact could not be a contract in any ordinary sense.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        Furthermore the alleged pact
        may be something altogether subjective, as is the case with the lunatics
        known as demonomaniacs. In such cases the patient imagines he has concluded
        a contract with the Devil, but there is absolutely nothing in reality
        corresponding to his illusion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        As for ways and means of binding a
        demon to the assistance of a human being in the exercise of magical powers,
        we assert that none such exist, and that if the demon enters the service of
        a person, he does so of his own accord under the lure of the elective
        affinity between his wickedness and the wickedness of the
        person.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
        Devil, moreover, is not above the laws of nature.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        He can do nothing that is not naturally possible in itself."

        (<i>Opera,</i> Vol. VI, p. 581), III, 7:
        "Demons are of such nature that with the senses of their aerial bodies
        they easily outstrip the senses of terrestrial bodies, and in view of the
        superior mobility of the same aerial bodies they incomparably excel in
        speed, let alone the legs of any human being or animal whatsoever, the very
        flight of birds. Endowed with those two things pertaining to the aerial
        body, to wit, sharpness of sense and swiftness of motion, they tell and
        foretell many things that are known to them before they are perceived by
        humans in view of the sluggishness of human senses. In view also of the long
        space of time over which their lives extend, demons acquire far greater
        experience than can be acquired in the short life of a human being."

        V, 9: "It should also be pointed out, while we are on this matter of
        foresight in demons, that many times they merely predict things that they

        symptoms what the course of a disease is to be, "so in the trends and
        situations in the atmosphere that are known to him but unknown to us, the
        demon foresees approaching storms." Tertullian, <i>Apologeticus,</i> XXII, 10:

        Macrobius, <i>Saturnalia,</i> II, 9: "It seems that all cities are protected
        by certain gods; and it was a secret custom of the Romans, unknown to many,
        that when they besieged an enemy city and thought they were on the point of
        conquering it, they 'called forth' its tutelary gods with a certain ritual.
        For otherwise they did not think it possible to take the city, or, had it
        been, they thought it impious to make captives of gods. For the same reason,
        the Romans were careful that the name of the patron god of Rome should
        remain secret, and even the Latin name of the city." Macrobius then gives a
        formula for addressing the gods of a besieged city and another for
        consecrating cities and armies after worshipping such gods. But he cautions
        that only dictators and generals-in-chief could use them effectively: "Dis,
        the Father, Veiovis, Manes, or by whatever other name it is proper to
        address thee&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." The words of the formula had to be punctuated by
        specified acts: "When he says 'Earth,' he touches the earth with his hands.
        When he says 'Jove,' he raises his
        hands towards heaven. When he is acknowledging a vow, he touches his
        breast with his hands." Such things would be ridiculous if the idea were
        merely to make the gods understand. They are rational if words and gestures
        have an efficacy of their own. Virgil, <i>Aeneid,</i> II, v. 351: "The shrines and
        altars were deserted, for all the gods had gone away." And Servius annotates
        (Thilo-Hagen, Vol. I, p. 277): "Because, before the storming [of a city] the
        gods were 'called forth' by the enemy that sacrilege might be avoided. That
        is why the Romans would never let it be known under the tutelage of just
        what god the <i>Urbs</i> abided and the law of the pontiffs cautioned that the
        Roman gods should not be addressed by name lest they be tampered with
        (<i>exaugurari</i>). And on the Capitol there was a consecrated shield with the
        inscription: <i>Genio Urbis Romae sive mas sive foemina</i> (whether male or
        female). And the pontiffs prayed as follows: <i>'Jupiter Optime Maxime</i>&mdash;or
        whatever you prefer to be called; and he [Virgil] himself says, <i>Aeneid,</i> IV,
        vv. 576-77: 'Thee we follow, holiest of gods, whoever thou art.' "

        <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 202. The same writer gives the following version of the
        ritual used at Iguvium, pp. 170-71: "The augur's assistant speaking from his
        station will propose as follows to the augur: 'I stipulate that you are to
        watch&mdash;a hawk on the right, a raven on the right, a woodpecker on the
        left, a magpie on the left, birds in flight on the left, birds singing on
        the left, being omens favourable to me.' The augur will stipulate as
        follows: 'I will watch&mdash;a hawk on the right, a raven on the right, a
        woodpecker on the left, birds in flight on the left and birds singing on the
        left, being favourable to me on behalf of the people of Iguvium in this
        particular temple.'" Cicero, <i>De divinatione,</i> II, 33, 71: "As regards
        fictitious signs taken as auspices (<i>ut sint auspicia quae nulla sunt</i>) those
        certainly which are customary with us, whether by the feeding of chickens or
        by lightning (<i>de caelo</i>), are mock-auguries (<i>simulacra auspiciorum</i>) and in no
        sense real ones." And condnuing, 34, 71: " 'Quintus Fabius, I beg you to be
        my augur.' And he answers: 'Gladly!' With our forefathers, an expert was
        used for such purposes&mdash;nowadays anybody will do. However, it does take
        an expert to know what 'silence' is&mdash;'silence' being the name given in
        the taking of auguries to the circumstance where there is no trace of
        blemish. It is the test of the perfect augur to be able to determine that.
        When the augur says to his assistant, 'Tell me whether there seems to be
        silence,' the assistant does not look up, he does not look around&mdash;he
        answers blithely (<i>statim</i>): 'There seems to be silence.' Then the augur:
        'Tell me if they are eating.' 'They are eating.' " Livy, <i>Ab urbe condita,</i> X,
        40, 11, records an instance where an augury, though invented, was taken as
        favourable from the simple fact of being "renounced." The consul Papirius is
        informed by his nephew, a pious lad, that his auspices have been
        fraudulently reported. Papirius replies: "Blessings on you for your
        conscientiousness
        and virtue! But if the augur makes a false announcement, the responsibility
        to the gods rests with him. I have the report that the corn danced [when the
        chickens refused to eat it] and that is a first-class omen for this army and
        for the Roman People!"

        66-67: The Argives took advantage of these traits in their neighbours, the
        Spartans. At the time of the war against Epidaurus, while the Spartans were
        sitting inactive for the whole month called Karneios, the Argives
        arbitrarily decreed the month shortened by four days and opened hostilities
        (Thucydides, <i>Historiae,</i> V, 54, 3-4). [Smith, Vol. III, p. 107: "The Argives

        and Delphi for an opinion as to whether he was bound to grant a truce. He

        Servius, <i>In Vergilii Aeneidem,</i> IX, v. 52 (Thilo-Hagen, Vol. II, pp.
        315-16): "Thirty-three days after service of the demands upon the enemy, the
        College of Feciales sent their spear. But in the case of (<i>temporibus</i>)
        Pyrrhus the Romans were to make war on a power overseas, and they could find
        no place to celebrate the ceremony of a declaration of war by the Feciales.
        They accordingly arranged for a soldier of Pyrrhus to be captured, and
        caused him to buy a plot of ground in the Flaminian Circus, that they might
        comply with the rite of declaring war on hostile territory. Then a column
        was erected on the spot at the foot of the statue of Bellona and duly
        consecrated." The commander-in-chief of an army had to keep his auspices in
        order, and that could be done only on the Capitol. But how do that when he
        was in a distant land? A very simple matter! An imitation Capitol was built
        on foreign soil, and the auspices were taken there. <i>Ibid., Aeneid,</i> II, v.
        178 (Thilo-Hagen, Vol. I, p. 250): "... Or a site was chosen for a tent in
        which the auspices should be taken. But this practice [of taking the urban
        auspices] was observed by the Roman generals so long as they were fighting
        in Italy, in view of the nearness. But as the Empire was extended far
        abroad, that the general might not be too long separated from the army by
        returning to Rome from long distances to take the auspices it was ordained
        that a plot of conquered territory should be 'made Roman' in the district
        where hostilities were in progress, and the general could repair thither if
        his auspices had to be renewed."

        This is a controversial point which we need not go into for the

        Mommsen, <i>Römische Geschichte,</i> Vol. I-1, p. 244 (Dixon, Vol. I, pp.
        254-55): "Everywhere, in Rome, among the Latins, the Sabellians, the
        Etruscans, the Apulians, in all the Italic cities, in a word, as well as in
        the Greek cities, magistrates holding office for life gave way to
        magistrates appointed annually. Among the Greek cities Sparta of course is
        an exception. It is interesting that Rome and the Italic cities did not have
        an age of tyrants as Greece did; and the absence of such a stage in Italy
        was probably due, at least in part, to the psychic state of the Italian
        peoples, a psychic state more conspicuously noticeable in Rome. In Sparta,
        the two kings owed their royal dignity to hereditary succession; they
        presided at councils, administered justice, commanded the army, and served
        as intermediaries between Sparta and the gods."

        Traditions are all unanimous in showing that the consuls inherited
        virtually all the powers of the kings. Livy, <i>Ab urbe condita,</i> II, 1, 7: "You
        may set down the origins of our liberty rather to the fact that the consular authority
        was limited to a year than to any diminution of the powers the kings had
        held. The first consuls kept all the prerogatives and all the ceremony of
        the kings." Cicero, <i>De republica,</i> II, 32, 56: "The Senate, accordingly, held
        the State in the same balance in that period.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Though the consuls had a
        merely annual authority, in character and prerogative it was a royal
        authority." <i>Cf.</i> also Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <i>Antiquitates Romanae,</i> IV,
        73-75 (Spelman, Vol. II, pp. 277-81). It is unimportant, for our purposes,
        whether these traditions be more or less authentic. In any event they reveal
        the psychic state of those who gave them the form they have or in part
        invented them, and that psychic state is the thing we are trying to stress.

        Valerius Maximus, <i>De dictis factisque memorabilibus,</i> III, 8, 3, tells
        how C. Piso refused to "renounce" M. Palicanus, a notorious trouble-maker
        whom he considered unworthy of the consulate: "In this situation, as
        lamentable as it was disgraceful, Piso was almost dragged to the rostrum by
        the tribunes; and they [the mob] crowded about him on all sides, demanding
        whether he intended to announce Palicanus as elected consul by the votes of
        the People. At first he answered that 'he did not think the Republic had so
        far lost its mind that things would ever come to such a shameful pass.'
        'Well,' they pressed, insisting on an answer, 'if things do come to that
        pass?' 'I will not announce him!' he said." Aulus Gellius, <i>Noctes Atticae,</i>
        VII, 9, 3: "But the aedile who was presiding over the assembly said he would
        not accept the nomination and that it was not his pleasure that a recorder
        (<i>qui scriptum faceret:</i> a scribe) should become an aedile." The same incident
        is mentioned in Livy, <i>Ab urbe condita,</i> IX, 46, 2. There are many other
        examples of the kind. Livy, <i>Ibid.,</i> XXXIX, 39: "The consul, Lucius Porcius,
        was at first of the opinion that he [Fulvius Flaccus] should not be
        recognized as a candidate." The <i>Lex Iulia municipalis,</i> I, 132 (Girard,
        <i>Textes de droit romain,</i> p. 78), as reconstituted by Mommsen, expressly
        forbids "renouncement" of individuals reputed unfit: "Nor shall any of you
        take account of him from the <i>comitia</i> or the council, nor shall any of you
        announce anyone so elected by the <i>comitia</i> or the council against these
        things [i.e., principles]."

        toothsome dame, and was sitting about with her body quite largely exposed as
        though by oversight. Said Antoninus: 'I would, if the law allowed.' And she
        is said to have answered: <i>'Si libet, licet. An nescis te imperatorem esse et
          leges dare non accipere?' "</i> Aurelius Victor, <i>De Caesaribus,</i> XXI: "He [Caracalla] was like his
        father in his
        wealth and in the marriage he made; for enamoured of the beauty of Julia,
        his step-mother, whose crimes I have already recounted, he sought her for
        his wife. Frowardly she exposed her body to his gaze, as though unaware of
        his presence&mdash;he being very young; and when he said, <i>'Vellem si liceret
          uti!',</i> she, saucily enough, in fact stripping her shame of every veil,
        replied: <i>'Libet?</i> Then, by all means, <i>licet!' "</i> In this form the anecdote must
        be fictional in character. Actually Julia was Caracalla's mother, not his
        step-mother.

        Bréal-Bailly, <i>Dictionnaire étymologique latin, s.v.</i> Lego, derive
        <i>religio</i> from <i>lego: "Religio</i> meant 'conscientiousness,' and particularly
        conscientiousness in matters of piety.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From that first meaning all
        others are derived." Bréal's etymology is no longer accepted; but that is of
        scant importance, for neither in this case nor in any other do we intend to
        infer the character of a thing from the etymology of its name. Forcellini
        errs in representing as derived a meaning that more probably is primitive,
        but he states it very well: <i>"Religio:</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 10: figuratively, minute and
        scrupulous diligence and care: Italian <i>esattezza.</i> Cicero, <i>Brutus,</i> 82, 283:
        <i>'Eins oratio nimia religione attenuata</i> [His style was cramped by too great
        conscientiousness]'; <i>Idem, Orator ad Marcum Brutum,</i> 8, 25: 'It was the wise
        and sound convicdon of the Athenians that they could listen to nothing that
        was not well-bred (<i>elegans</i>) and free from blemish; and if their orator was
        attentive to this fastidiousness on their part (<i>quorum religioni cum
          serviret</i>), he never dared utter a word that was insolent or distasteful':
        Italian <i>delicatezza.</i> 11: <i>Iusta muneris functio</i> [consciendous performance of
        duty]: Italian <i>puntualità."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        One might caution, meantime, that the primitive meaning of <i>superstitio</i> was
        not at all what we mean by "superstition," but rather "excessive piety,"
        something overstepping the orderliness, the regularity, so dear to the
        Romans. Aulus Gellius, <i>Noctes Atticae,</i> IV, 9, 1-3, quotes a line from an
        ancient poem, <i>"Religentem esse oportet, religiosus ne fuas,"</i> and the maxim
        means, he explains, that one should be "religious" (observant of one's pious
        duties) but not "superstitious" (not so observant to excess). And he cites
        Nigidius on the point: "That is the connotation of all words of the kind:
        <i>vinosus, mulierosus, religiosus, nummosus</i> ("overrich"), which suggest
        immoderate abundance of the quality alluded to. So a "religious" man was a
        man who had bound himself to an excessive, overconscientious observance of
        his pious duties (<i>religione</i>), so that the trait could be called a defect in
        him.' " Gellius continues: "But in addition to the sense mentioned by
        Nigidius, by another shade of meaning (<i>diverticulo</i>) a man of pure life
        scrupulously observing certain rules and keeping himself within certain
        limits may be called a 'religious' man."

        Even if we stick to the Latin form of the word, some people will
        insist on understanding it in a sense altogether different from the meaning
        we wish to give it, whether because of its similarity to the word "religion"
        or because of other senses that the word has in Latin. It is my sad
        experience that no precaution can prevent people from taking terms in their

        miles from the city, across the Anio] in defiance of consular orders."

        Cicero, <i>In Caium Verrem,</i> II, 23, 60: "We have heard of individuals not
        keeping books&mdash;that charge was made against Antony, but falsely, for
        his books were in the best of order. All the same there are some few
        examples of such reprehensible conduct. Then again we have heard of
        individuals whose books are missing for certain periods&mdash;and one might
        imagine reasons to justify that conduct. But what is unheard of and
        altogether ridiculous is the reply Verres made when we asked him to produce
        his books. He said that he had kept them up to the consulships of M.
        Terentius and C. Cassius, but had ceased doing so after that." On this
        passage Asconius annotates: "It was the custom for each Roman to keep his
        domestic accounts day by day over his whole life, so that it might be
        apparent for each day what he had laid aside from his income, what his
        earnings from trade, business, or money loaned, and what his expenditures or
        losses." To the demand on his client, M. Coelius, to produce his books,
        Cicero replies, <i>Pro Marco Coelio,</i> 7, 17: "A man who is still a junior in his
        family (<i>qui in patris potestate est</i>) is not required to keep books."

        Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <i>Antiquitates Romanae,</i> II, 19 (Spelman,
        Vol. I, p. 257): "One does not hear among the Romans of a Uranus castrated
        by his sons, of a Saturn devouring his children, of a Jove dethroning a
        Saturn and making him a prisoner in Tartarus; nor of divine wars and
        maimings, nor of gods in chains and made slaves of men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        (<i>οὐδέ γε πόλεμοι καὶ τραύματα καὶ δεσμοὶ καὶ θητεῖαι θεῶν παρ᾽ἀνθρώποις</i>)."
        According to Dionysius even rites of worship were more moral in Rome than in
        Greece.

        According to Plutarch, <i>Nicias,</i> 23, 2-3 (Perrin, Vol. III, p. 291),
        Anaxagoras disclosed his theories of eclipses only to a few individuals. But
        at that time such speculations were not tolerated in Athens. "Protagoras was
        exiled. Anaxagoras was thrown into prison and extricated by Pericles with
        great difficulty. Socrates did not deal with physical sciences, but was none
        the less put to death because of his philosophy." <i>Idem, Pericles,</i> 32, 2
        (Perrin, Vol. III, p. 93): "A law proposed by Diopeithes made it an
        actionable offence to deny the existence of the gods and discuss celestial
        things; and that brought suspicion upon Pericles because of Anaxagoras."
        Diogenes Laertius, <i>Anaxagoras,</i> II, 3, 12 (Hicks, Vol. I, p. 143), says that
        Anaxagoras was accused of impiety by Cleon for having asserted that the sun
        was a molten mass. Plato, <i>Apologia,</i> 26, (14) (Fowler, p. 99), imagines
        Meletus as accusing Socrates of saying that the sun is a stone and the moon
        an earth. To which Socrates replies: "You must think you are accusing
        Anaxagoras, friend Meletus."

        Cicero, <i>De haruspicum responsis,</i> 9, 19: <i>"Quam volumus licet, patres
          conscripti, ipsi nos amemus, tamen nec numero Hispanos, nec robore Gallos,
          nec calliditate Poenos, nec artibus Graecos, nec denique hoc ipso huius
          gentis ac terrae domestico nativoque sensu, Italos ipsos ac Latinos, sed
          pietate ac religione, atque hac una sapientia, quod deorum immortalium
          numine omnia regi gubernarique perspeximus, omnes gentes nationesque
          superavimus."</i> In the <i>De natura deorum,</i> II, 3, 8, Cicero makes Balbus say:
        "And if we were to compare our national traits with those of other peoples,
        we would find ourselves their inferiors or at the best their equals in many
        things, but their superiors and by far in <i>religio,</i> which means worship of
        the gods." Note that <i>religio</i> is here defined as worship (<i>cultu</i>).

        This qualification is necessary, for with the first decade of the
        twentieth century the government of England fell into the hands of Welsh and
        Irish fanatics. If that is not just a passing fancy but indicates a change
        in the character of the country as a whole, the England of the future will
        be nothing like the England of
        the past. It is to the latter England, the only England very well known as
        yet, that I refer when I mention that country in these pages.
