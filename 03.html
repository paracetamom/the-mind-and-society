  <h2>Chapter III. Rationalization of Non-logical Conduct</h2>

  <p id="section-0249">
    <strong>249.</strong>
    The research just completed has called our attention&mdash;along with a
    number of incidental inductions&mdash;to the following facts:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. The existence and importance of non-logical conduct. That runs counter to
    many sociological theories that either scorn or ignore non-logical actions,
    or else, in an effort to reduce all conduct to logic, attach little
    importance to them. The course we follow in studying the behaviour of human
    beings as bearing on the social equilibrium differs according as we lay the
    greater stress on logical or non-logical conduct. We had better look into
    that matter more deeply, therefore.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Non-logical actions are generally considered from the logical standpoint
    both by those who perform them and by those who discuss them and generalize
    about them. Hence our need to do a thing of supreme importance for our
    purposes here&mdash;to tear off the masks non-logical conduct is made to
    wear and lay bare the things they hide from view. That too runs counter to
    many theories which halt at logical exteriors, representing them not as
    masks but as the substantial element in conduct itself. We have to
    scrutinize those theories closely: for if we were to find them true&mdash;in
    accord with experience, that is&mdash;we would have to follow an altogether
    different course from the one we would follow were we to discover that the
    substantial element in the conduct lies in the things that underlie the
    logical exteriors (§ <a href="02.html#section-0146">146</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    3. The experimental truth of a theory and its social utility are different
    things. A theory that is experimentally true may be now advantageous, now
    detrimental, to society; and the same applies to a theory that is
    experimentally false. Many many people deny that. We must therefore not rest
    satisfied with the rapid survey we have made so far, much less with the bald
    declaration in § <a href="01.html#section-0072">72</a>. We must
    see whether observation of the facts confirms or belies our induction
    (§§ <a href="01.html#section-0072">72</a>-73).
  </p>
  <p>
    4. As regards logical and non-logical conduct there are differences between
    individual human beings, or, taking things in the mass, between social
    classes, and differences also in the degrees of utility that theories
    experimentally true or experimentally false have for individuals or classes.
    And the same applies to the sentiments that are expressed through
    non-logical conduct. Many people deny such differences. To not a few the
    mere suggestion that they exist seems scandalous. It will therefore be
    necessary to continue our examination of that subject, on which we have
    barely touched, and clearly establish just what the facts have to say.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0250">
    <strong>250.</strong>
    Meantime, our first survey has already given us an idea, however
    superficial, of the answers that have to be given to the inquiries suggested
    in §§ <a href="01.html#section-0013">13</a>-14 as to the motives underlying theories, as to their bearing on
    experimental realities, and as to individual and group utilities&mdash;and
    we see that some at least of the distinctions that are drawn in those
    paragraphs are not merely hypothetical, but have points of correspondence
    with reality.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0251">
    <strong>251.</strong>
    In the following pages we shall devote ourselves chiefly to running
    down non-logical actions in the theories or descriptions of social facts
    that have been put forward by this or that writer; and that will give us an
    approximate notion of the way non-logical conduct is masked by logic.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0252">
    <strong>252.</strong>
    If non-logical actions are really as important as our induction so far
    would lead us to suppose, it would be strange indeed that the many men of
    talent who have applied themselves to the study of human societies should
    not have noticed them in any way. Distracted by preconceptions or led astray
    by erroneous theories, they may, "as they that have spent eyes," have caught
    imperfect glimpses of them; but it is hard to believe that they can have
    seen nothing where we find so much that is of such great significance. Let
    us therefore see just how the matter stands.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0253">
    <strong>253.</strong>
    But for that purpose we have to take an even more general view of
    things: we have to see to what extent reality is disfigured
    in the theories and descriptions of it that one finds in the literature of
    thought. We have an image in a curved mirror; our problem is to discover the
    form of the object so altered by refraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose we ignore, for the moment, the simplest case of writers who
    understand that the conduct of human beings depends, to some extent at
    least, on the environment in which they live, on climate, race, occupation,
    "temperament." It is obvious that the behaviour resulting from such causes
    is not the product of pure ratiocination, that it is non-logical behaviour.
    To be sure, that fact is often overlooked by the very writers who have
    stressed it, and they therefore seem to be contradicting themselves. But the
    inconsistency is now and again more apparent than real; for when a writer
    admits such causes he is usually dealing with what <i>is</i>&mdash;and that is one
    thing. When he insists on having all conduct logical, he is usually
    describing what, in his opinion, <i>ought to be</i>&mdash;and that is quite another
    thing. From the scientific laboratory he steps over into the pulpit.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0254">
    <strong>254.</strong>
    Let us begin with cases not quite so simple but where it is still easy
    to perceive the experimental truth underneath imperfect and partly erroneous
    descriptions of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, for instance, is <i>The Ancient City</i> of Fustel de Coulanges. In it we
    read, p. 73 (Small, p. 89): "From all these beliefs, all these customs, all
    these laws, it clearly results that from the religion of the hearth human
    beings learned to appropriate the soil and on it based their title to it."
    But, really, is it not surprising that domestic religion should have
    preceded ownership of land? And Fustel gives ho proof whatever of such a
    thing! The opposite may very well have been the case&mdash;or religion and
    ownership of land may have developed side by side. It is evident that Fustel
    has the preconceived notion that possession has to have a "cause." On that
    assumption, he seeks the cause and finds it in religion; and so the act of
    possession becomes a logical action derived from religion, which in its turn
    can now be logically derived from some other cause. By a singular
    coincidence it happens that in this instance Fustel himself supplies the
    necessary rectification. A little earlier, p. 63 (Small, p. 78), he writes:
    "There are three things which, from the most ancient times, one
    finds founded and solidly established in these Greek and Italian
    communities: domestic religion, the family, the right of property&mdash;
    three things which were obviously related in the beginning and which seem to
    have been inseparable."
  </p>
  <p>
    How did Fustel fail to see that his two passages were contradictory? If
    three things <i>A, B, C</i> are "inseparable," one of them, for instance <i>A,</i> cannot
    have produced another, for instance <i>B:</i> for if <i>A</i> produced <i>B,</i> that would mean
    that, at the time, <i>A</i> was separate from <i>B.</i> We are therefore compelled to make
    a choice between the two propositions. If we keep the first, we have to
    discard the second, and <i>vice versa.</i> As a matter of fact, we have to adopt
    the second, discarding the proposition that places religion and property in
    a relationship of cause and effect, and keeping the one that puts them in a
    relationship of interdependence (§§ <a href="01.html#section-0138">138</a>, <a href="#section-0267">267</a>). The
    very facts noted by
    Fustel himself force that choice upon us. He writes, p. 64 (Small, p. 79):
    "And the family, which by duty and religion remains grouped around its
    altar, becomes fixed to the soil like the altar itself." But the criticism
    occurs to one of its own accord: "Yes, provided that be possible!" For if we
    assume a social state in which the family cannot settle on the soil, it is
    the religion that has to be modified. What obviously has happened is a
    series of actions and reactions, and we are in no position to say just how
    things stood in the beginning. The fact that certain people came to live in
    separate families fixed to the soil had as one of its manifestations a
    certain kind of religion; and that religion, in its turn, contributed to
    keeping the families separate and fixed to the soil (§ <a href="#section-1021">1021</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0255">
    <strong>255.</strong>
    In this we have an example of a very common error, which lies in
    substituting relationships of cause and effect for relationships of
    interdependence (§ <a href="01.html#section-0138">138</a>); and that error gives rise to still another: the
    error of placing the alleged effect, erroneously regarded as the logical
    product of the alleged cause, in the class of logical actions.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0256">
    <strong>256.</strong>
    When Polybius stresses religion as one of the causes of the power of
    Rome (§ <a href="#section-0313">313</a>), we will accept the remark
    as very suggestive; but we will reject the logical explanation
    that he gives of the fact
    (§ <a href="#footnote-0313-01" id="ref-0313-031">313<sup>1</sup></a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    In Sumner Maine's <i>Ancient haw,</i> p. 122, we find another example like
    Fustel's. Maine observes that ancient societies were made up of families.
    That is a question of fact which we choose not to go into&mdash; researches
    into origins are largely hypothetical anyway. Let us accept Maine's data for
    what they are worth&mdash;just as hypotheses. From the fact he draws the
    conclusion that ancient law was "adjusted to a system of small independent
    corporations." That too is good: institutions adjust themselves to states of
    fact! But then suddenly we find the notion of logical conduct creeping
    stealthily in, p. 177: "Men are regarded and treated, not as individuals,
    but always as members of a particular group." It would be more exact to say
    that men are that in reality, and law, accordingly, develops <em>as if</em> men were
    regarded and treated as members of a particular group.
  </p>
  <p>
    A little earlier, Maine's intromission of logical conduct is more obtrusive.
    Following his remark that ancient societies were made up of small
    independent corporations, he adds, p. 122: "Corporations <em>never die,</em> and
    accordingly primitive law considers the entities with which it deals, <i>i.e.,</i>
    patriarchal or family groups, as perpetual and inextinguishable." From that
    Maine derives as a consequence the institution of transmission, upon
    decease, of the <i>universitas iuris,</i> which we find in Roman law. Such a
    logical sequence may easily be compatible with a posterior logical analysis
    of antecedent non-logical actions, but it does not picture the facts
    accurately. To come nearer to them we have to invert some of the terms in
    Maine's previous remarks. The succession of the <i>universitas iuris</i> does not
    derive from the concept of a continuous corporation: the latter concept
    derives from the fact of succession. A family, or some other ethnic group,
    occupies a piece of land, comes to own flocks, and so on. The fact of
    perpetuity of occupation, of possession, is in all probability antecedent to
    any abstract concept, to any concept of a law of inheritance. That is
    observable even in animals. The great felines occupy certain hunting-grounds
    and these remain properties of the various
    families, unless human beings chance to interfere.<sup><a href="#footnote-0256-01" id="ref-0256-01">1</a></sup> The
    ant-hill is
    perpetual, yet one may doubt whether ants have any concept of the
    corporation or of inheritance. In human beings, the fact gave rise to the
    concept. Then man, being a logical animal, had to discover the "why" of the
    fact; and among the many explanations he imagined, he may well have hit
    upon the one suggested by Sumner Maine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maine is one of the writers who have best shown the difference between
    <em>customary</em> law (law as <em>fact</em>) and <em>positive</em> law (law as <em>theory</em>); yet he forgets
    that distinction time and again, so persuasive is the concept that posits
    logical conduct everywhere. Customary law is made up of a complex of
    non-logical actions that regularly recur. Positive law comprises two
    elements: first, a logical&mdash;or pseudo-logical or even
    imaginary&mdash;analysis of the non-logical actions in question; second,
    implications of the principles resulting from that analysis. Customary law
    is not merely primitive: it goes hand in hand with positive law, creeps
    unobtrusively into jurisprudence, and modifies it. Then the day comes when
    the theory of such modifications is formulated&mdash;the caterpillar becomes
    a butterfly&mdash;and positive law opens a new chapter.

    Of the assassination of Caesar, Duruy writes:<sup><a href="#footnote-0257-01" id="ref-0257-01">1</a></sup> "Ever
    since the
    foundation of the Republic the Roman aristocracy had adroitly fostered in
    the people a horror for the name of king." In that the logical varnish for
    conduct that is non-logical is easily recognizable. Then he goes on: "If the
    monarchical solution answered the needs of the times, it was almost
    inevitable that the first monarch should pay for his throne with his life,
    as our Henry IV paid for his." In such "needs of the times" we recognize at
    once one of those amiable
    fictions which historians try to palm off as something concrete. As for the
    law that first monarchs in dynasties have to die by assassination, history
    gives no experimental proof of any such fact. We have to see in it a mere
    reminiscence of the classical <i>fatum,</i> and pack it
    off to keep company with many similar products of the scholarly fancy.

    Shall we banish from history the prodigies that Suetonius never forgets
    to enumerate in connexion with the births or deaths of the Roman Emperors,
    without trying to interpret them&mdash;for we shall see how mistaken such an
    effort on our part would be
    (§ <a href="#section-0672">672</a>)&mdash;and shall we keep only such of his facts as are, or at least seem
    to be, historical? Shall we do the same with all similar historical
    sources&mdash;for instance, with histories of the Crusades?<sup><a href="#footnote-0258-01"

  <p>In doing that
    we should be on dangerous ground, for if we made
    it an absolute rule to divide all our narrative sources into two elements,
    one miraculous, incredible, which we reject, and another natural, plausible,
    which we retain, we should certainly fall into very serious errors (§ <a href="#section-0674">674</a>).
    The part that is accepted has to have extrinsic probabilities of truth,

    with other evidence.

    From a legend we can learn nothing that is strictly historical; but we
    can learn something, and often a great deal, about the psychic state of the
    people who invented or believed it; and on knowledge of such psychci states our research is
    based. We shall therefore often cite facts without trying to ascertain
    whether they are historical or legendary; because for the use we are going
    to make of them they are just as serviceable in the one case as in the
    other&mdash;sometimes, indeed, they are better legendary than historical.

    Logical interpretations of non-logical conduct become in their turn
    causes of logical conduct and sometimes even of non-logical conduct; and
    they have to be reckoned with in determining the social equilibrium. From
    that standpoint, the interpretations of plain people are generally of
    greater importance than the interpretations of scholars. As regards the
    social equilibrium, it is of far greater moment to know what the plain man
    understands by "virtue" than to know what philosophers think about it.

    Rare the writer who fails to take any account of non-logical conduct
    whatever; but generally the interest is in certain natural inclinations of
    temperament, which, willynilly, the writer has to credit to human beings.
    But the eclipse of logic is of short duration&mdash; driven off at one
    point, it reappears at some other. The rôle of temperament is reduced to
    lowest terms, and it is assumed that people draw logical inferences from it
    and act in accordance with them.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0262">
    <strong>262.</strong>
    So much for the general situation. But in the particular, theorists
    have another very powerful motive for preferring to think of non-logical
    conduct as logical. If we assume that certain conduct is logical, it is much
    easier to formulate a theory about it than it is when we take it as
    non-logical. We all have handy in our minds the tool for producing logical
    inferences, and nothing else is needed. Whereas in order to organize a
    theory of non-logical conduct we have to consider hosts and hosts of facts,
    ever extending the scope of our researches in space and in time, and ever
    standing on our guard lest we be led into error by imperfect documents. In
    short, for the person who would frame such a theory, it is a long and
    difficult task to find outside himself materials that his mind supplied
    directly with the aid of mere logic when he was dealing with logical
    conduct.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0263">

    If the science of political economy has advanced much farther than
    sociology, that is chiefly because it deals with logical conduct.<sup><a href="#footnote-0263-01"
        id="ref-0263-01">1</a></sup>
    It would
    have been a soundly constituted science from the start had it not
    encountered a grave obstacle in the interdependence of the phenomena it
    examines, and at a time when the scholars who were devoting themselves to it
    were unable to utilize the one method so far discovered for dealing with
    interdependencies. The obstacle was surmounted, in part at least, when
    mathematics came to be applied to economic phenomena, whereby the new
    science of mathematical economics was built up, a science well able to hold
    its own with the other natural sciences.<sup><a href="#footnote-0263-02" id="ref-0263-02">2</a></sup>

    Other considerations tend to keep thinkers from the field of
    non-logical conduct and carry them over into the field of the logical. Most
    scholars are not satisfied with discovering what is. They are anxious to
    know, and even more anxious to explain to others, what <i>ought</i> to be. In that
    sort of research, logic reigns supreme; and so the moment they catch sight
    of conduct that is non-logical, instead of going ahead along that road they
    turn aside, often seem to forget its existence, at any rate generally ignore
    it, and beat the well-worn path that leads to logical conduct.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0265">
    <strong>265.</strong>
    Some writers likewise rid themselves of non-logical actions by
    regarding them&mdash;often without saying as much explicitly&mdash;as
    scandalous things, or at least as irrelevant things, which should have no
    place in a well-ordered society. They think of them as "superstitions" that
    ought to be extirpated by the exercise of intelligence. Nobody, in practice,
    acts on the assumption that the physical and the moral constitution of an
    individual do not have at least some small share in determining his
    behaviour. But when it comes to framing a theory, it is held that the human
    being <i>ought</i> to act rationally, and writers deliberately close their minds to
    things that the experience of every day holds up before their eyes.

    It plays no small part in the common misapprehension whereby two
    phenomena are placed in a relationship of cause and effect for the simple
    reason that they are found in company. We have already alluded to that error
    (§ <a href="#section-0255">255</a>); but we must now advance a little farther in our study of it, for it
    is of no mean importance to sociology.

    Let <i>C,</i> as in Figure 3, § <a href="02.html#section-0166">166</a>, stand for a belief; <i>D,</i> for certain
    behaviour.
    Instead of saying simply, "Some people do <i>D</i> and believe <i>C,"</i> ordinary speech
    goes farther and says, "Some people do <i>D</i> <em>because</em> they believe <i>C."</i> Taken
    strictly, that proposition is often false. Less often false is the
    proposition, "Some people believe <i>C</i> <em>because</em>
    they do <i>D."</i> But there are still many occasions when all that we can say is,
    "Some men do <i>D</i> and believe <i>C."</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the proposition, "Some people do <i>D</i> <em>because</em> they believe <i>C,"</i> the logical
    strictness of the term "because" can be so attenuated that no relationship
    of cause and effect is set up between <i>C</i> and <i>D.</i> We can then say, "We may
    assume that certain people do <i>D</i> <em>because</em> they have a belief <i>C</i> which expresses
    sentiments that impel them to do <i>D";</i> that is because (going back to Figure
    3), they have a psychic state <i>A</i> that is expressed by <i>C.</i> In such a form the
    proposition closely approximates the truth, as we saw in § <a href="02.html#section-0166">166</a>.

    Although case III is not the only case, nor even the most frequent
    case, people are inclined to regard it as general and to merge with it cases
    I and II to which they preferably attribute little or no importance.
    Ordinary language, with its lack of exactness, encourages the error, because
    a person may state case III explicitly
    and be unconsciously thinking meantime of cases I and II. It often happens,
    besides, that we get mixtures of the three cases in varying proportions.

    Aristotle opens his <i>Politics,</i> I, 1, 1 (Rackham, p. 3), with the
    statement: "Seeing that every city is a society (Rackham, "partnership") and
    that every society (partnership) is constituted to the end of some good (for
    all men work to achieve what to them seems good) it is manifest that all
    societies (partnerships) seek some good." Here we stand altogether in the
    domain of logic: with a deliberate purpose&mdash;the purpose of achieving a
    certain good&mdash;human beings have constituted a society that is called a
    city. It would seem as though Aristotle were on the point of going off into
    the absurdities of the "social contract"! But not so. He at once changes
    tack, and the principle he has stated he will use to determine what a city
    <em>ought</em> to be rather than what it actually is.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0271">
    <strong>271.</strong>
    The moment Aristotle has announced his principle&mdash;an association
    for purposes of mutual advantage&mdash;he tosses it aside and gives an
    altogether different account of the origin of society. First he notes the
    necessity of a union between the sexes, and soundly remarks that "that does
    not take place of deliberate choice"<sup><a href="#footnote-0271-01" id="ref-0271-01">1</a></sup>; wherewith,
    evidently, we enter the
    domain of non-logical conduct. He continues: "Nature has created certain
    individuals to command and others to obey." Among the Greeks Nature has so
    distinguished women and slaves. Not so among the Barbarians, for among the
    Barbarians, Nature has not appointed any individuals to command. We are
    still, therefore, in the domain of non-logical conduct; nor do we leave it
    when Aristotle explains that the two associations of master and slave,
    husband and wife, are the foundations of the family, that the village is
    constituted by several families, and that several villages form a state; nor
    when, finally, he concludes with the explicit declaration that "Every city,
    therefore, like the original associations, comes of Nature."<sup><a href="#footnote-0271-02"
        id="ref-0271-02">2</a></sup> One could not
    allude to non-logical actions in clearer terms.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0272">
    <strong>272.</strong>
    But, alas, if the city comes of Nature, it does not come of the
    deliberate will of citizens who get together for the purpose of achieving a
    certain advantage! There is an inconsistency between the principle first
    posited and the conclusion reached.<sup><a href="#footnote-0272-01" id="ref-0272-01">1</a></sup> Just how Aristotle
    fell into it we
    cannot know, but to accomplish that feat for oneself, one may proceed in the
    following fashion: First centre exclusively on the idea of "city," or
    "state." It will then be easy to connect city, or state, with the idea of
    "association," and then to connect association with the idea of <em>deliberate</em>
    association. So we get the first principle. But now think, in the second
    place, of the many many facts observable in a city or a state&mdash;the
    family, masters and slaves, and so on. Deliberate purpose will not fit in
    with those things very well. They suggest rather the notion of something
    that develops naturally. And so we get Aristotle's second description.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0273">
    <strong>273.</strong>
    He gets rid of the contradiction by metaphysics, which never withholds
    its aid in these desperate cases. Recognizing non-logical conduct, he says,
    I, 1, 12 (Rackham, pp. 11-13): "It is therefore manifest that the city is a
    product of Nature and is superior (prior) to man (to the individual). From
    Nature accordingly comes the tendency (an impulse) in all men toward such
    association. Therefore the man who first founded one was the cause of a very
    great good." So then, there is the inclination imparted by Nature; but it is
    further necessary that a man found the city. So a logical action is grafted
    upon the non-logical action (§ <a href="#section-0306">306</a>, I-<i>β</i>); and there is no help for that,
    for, says Aristotle, Nature does nothing in vain.<sup><a href="#footnote-0273-01" id="ref-0273-01">1</a></sup> Our
    best thanks,
    therefore, to that estimable demoiselle for so neatly rescuing a philosopher
    from a predicament!

    <strong>274.</strong>
    In distinguishing the Greeks from the Barbarians in his celebrated
    theory of natural slavery, Aristotle avails himself of the concept of
    non-logical conduct. It is obvious, among other things, that logic being the
    same for Greeks and Barbarians, if all actions were logical there could not
    be any difference between Greeks and Barbarians. But that is not all. Good
    observer that he is, Aristotle notices differences among Greek citizens.
    Speaking of the forms of democracy he says, VI, 2, 1 (Rackham, pp. 497-98):
    "Excellent is an agricultural people; consequently one can institute a
    democracy where a people lives by farming and sheep-raising." And he
    repeats, VI, 2, 7 (Rackham, p. 503): "Next after farmers, the best people
    are shepherds, or people who live by owning cattle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The other rabbles
    on which other sorts of democracy are based are greatly inferior." Here then
    we get clearly distinguished classes of citizens and almost a rudimentary
    economic determinism. But there is no reason for our stopping where
    Aristotle stops; and if we do go on we see that in general the conduct of
    human beings depends on their temperaments and occupations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cicero credits the ancestors of the Romans of his time with knowing that
    "the characters of human beings result not so much from race and family as
    from those things which are contributed by the nature of their localities
    for the ordinary conduct of life, and from which we draw our livelihood and
    subsistence. The Carthaginians were liars and cheats not by race but from
    the nature of their country, which with its port and its contacts with all
    sorts of merchants and foreigners speaking different languages inclined them
    through love of profits to love of trickery. The mountaineers of Liguria are
    harsh and uncouth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Capuans have ever been a supercilious people,
    because of the fertility of their soil, the wealth of their harvests, the
    salubriousness, the disposition, and the beauty of their city."<sup><a href="#footnote-0274-01"

  <p id="section-0275">
    <strong>275.</strong>
    In his <i>Rhetoric,</i> II, 12-14 (Freese, pp. 247-57), Aristotle makes an
    analysis, which came to be celebrated, of the traits of man according to
    age&mdash;in adolescence, in maturity, and in senility. He pushes his
    analysis further still, II, 12, 17 (Freese, pp. 257-63), and examines the
    effects on character of noble birth, wealth, and power&mdash;a splendidly
    conducted study. But all that evidently carries him into the domain of
    non-logical conduct.<sup><a href="#footnote-0275-01" id="ref-0275-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0276">
    <strong>276.</strong>
    Aristotle even has the concept of evolution. In the <i>Politics,</i> II, 5, 12
    (Rackham, pp. 129-31), he remarks that the ancestors of the Greeks probably
    resembled the vulgar and ignorant among his contemporaries.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0277">
    <strong>277.</strong>
    Had Aristotle held to the course he in part so admirably followed, we
    would have had a scientific sociology in his early day. Why did he not do
    so? There may have been many reasons; but chief among them, probably, was
    that eagerness for premature practical applications which is ever
    obstructing the progress of science, along with a mania for preaching to
    people as to what they ought to do&mdash;an exceedingly bootless
    occupation&mdash;instead of finding out what they actually do. His <i>History
      of Animals</i> avoids those causes of error, and that perhaps is why it is far
    superior to the <i>Politics</i> from the scientific point of view.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0278">
    <strong>278.</strong>
    It might seem strange to find traces of the concept of non-logical
    conduct in a dreamer like Plato; yet there they are! The notion transpires
    in the reasons Plato gives for establishing his colony far from the sea. To
    be near the sea begins by "being sweet" but ends by "being bitter" for a
    city: "for filling with commerce and traffic it develops capricious,
    untrustworthy instincts, and a breed of tricksters."<sup><a href="#footnote-0278-01" id="ref-0278-01">1</a></sup>
    Non-logical conduct
    has its place also in the well-known apologue of Plato on the races of
    mankind. The god who fashioned men mixed gold into the composition of those
    fit to govern, silver in guardians of the state (the warriors), iron in
    tillers of the soil and labourers. Plato also has a vague notion of what we
    are to call class-circulation, or circulation of <i>élites</i> (§§ <a href="#section-2026">2026</a> f.). He knows
    that individuals of the silver race may chance to be born in the race of
    gold, or <i>vice versa,</i> and so for the other races.<sup><a href="#footnote-0278-02" id="ref-0278-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0279">
    <strong>279.</strong>
    That being the case, if one would remain within the domain of science,
    one must go on and investigate the probable characteristics and the probable
    evolution of a society made up of different races of human beings, which are
    not reproduced from generation to generation with exactly the same
    characteristics and which are able to mix. That would be working towards a
    science of societies. But Plato has a very different purpose. He is little
    concerned with what is. He strains all his intellectual capacities to
    discover what <em>ought</em> to be. And thereupon non-logical conduct vanishes, and
    Plato's fancy goes sporting about among logical actions, which he invents in
    great numbers; and we find him at no great cost to himself appointing
    magistrates to put individuals who are born in a class but differ in traits
    from their parents in their proper places, and proclaiming laws to preserve
    or alter morals&mdash;in short, deserting the modest province of science to
    rise to the sublime heights of creation.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0280">
    <strong>280.</strong>
    The controversies on the question "Can virtue be taught?" also betray
    some distant conception of non-logical conduct. According to the documents
    in our possession, it would seem that Socrates regarded virtue as a science
    and left little room for non-logical actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-0280-01" id="ref-0280-01">1</a></sup> Plato and
    Aristotle abandon
    that extreme position. They hold that a certain natural inclination is
    necessary to "virtue." But that inclination once premised, back they go to
    the domain of logic, which is now called in to state the logical
    implications of temperament, and these in their turn determine human
    conduct. Those
    old controversies have points of resemblance with the disputes which took
    place long afterwards on "efficacious," and "non-efficacious," grace.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0281">
    <strong>281.</strong>
    The procedure of Plato and Aristotle in the controversies on the
    teaching of "virtue" is a general one. Non-logical actions are credited with
    a rôle that it would be absurd not to give them, but then that rôle is at
    once withdrawn, and people go back to the logical implications of
    inclinations; and by dividing those inclinations, which in fact cannot be
    ignored, into "good" ones and "bad" ones, a way is found to keep
    inclinations that are in accord with the logical system one prefers and to
    eliminate all others.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0282">
    <strong>282.</strong>
    St. Thomas tries to steer a deft course between the necessity of
    recognizing certain non-logical inclinations and a great desire to give full
    sway to reason, between the determinism of non-logical conduct and the
    doctrine of free will that is implicit in logical conduct. He says that
    "virtue is a good quality or disposition (<i>habitus</i>) of the soul, whereby one
    lives uprightly, which no one uses wrongly, and which God produces within us
    apart from any action by ourselves."<sup><a href="#footnote-0282-01" id="ref-0282-01">1</a></sup> Taken as a
    "disposition of the soul"
    virtue is classed with non-logical actions; and so it is when we say that
    God produces it in us apart from anything we do of ourselves. But by that
    divine interposition any uncertainty as to the character of non-logical
    conduct is removed, for it becomes logical according to the mind of God and
    therefore logical for the theologians who are so fortunate as to know the
    divine mind. Others use Nature for the same purpose and with the same
    results. People act according to certain inclinations. That reduces the rôle
    of the non-logical to a minimum, actions being regarded as logical
    consequences of the inclinations. Then even that very modest remnant is made
    to vanish as by sleight-of-hand; for inclinations are conceived as imparted
    by some entity
    (God, Nature, or something else) that acts logically (§ <a href="#section-0306">306</a>, I-<i>β</i>); so that
    even though the acting subject may on occasion believe that his actions are
    non-logical, those who know the mind, or the logical procedure, of the
    entity in question&mdash;and all philosophers, sociologists, and the like,
    have that privilege&mdash;know that all conduct is logical.

  <p id="section-0283">
    <strong>283.</strong>
    The controversy between Herbert Spencer and Auguste Comte brings out a
    number of interesting aspects of non-logical conduct.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0284">
    <strong>284.</strong>
    In his <i>Lectures on Positive Philosophy</i> (<i>Cours de philosophie positive</i>)
    Comte seems to be decidedly inclined to ascribe the predominance to logical
    conduct. He sees in positive philosophy, Vol. I, pp. 48-49, "the one solid
    basis for that social reorganization which is to terminate the critical
    state in which civilized nations have been living for so long a time." So
    then it is the business of theory to reorganize the world! How is that to
    come about? "Not to readers of these lectures should I ever think it
    necessary to prove that ideas govern and upset the world, or, in other
    terms, that the whole social mechanism rests, at bottom, on opinions. They
    are acutely aware that the great political and moral crisis in present-day
    society is due, in the last analysis, to our intellectual anarchy. Our most
    serious distress is caused by the profound differences of opinion that at
    present exist among all minds as to all those fundamental maxims the
    stability of which is the prime requisite for a real social order. So long
    as individual minds fail to give unanimous assent to a certain number of
    general ideas capable of constituting a common social doctrine, we cannot
    blind ourselves to the fact that the nations will necessarily remain in an
    essentially revolutionary atmosphere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is just as certain that if this
    gathering of minds to one communion of principles can once be attained, the
    appropriate institutions will necessarily take shape from it."
  </p>

  <p id="section-0285">
    <strong>285.</strong>
    After quoting Comte's dictum that ideas govern and upset the world,
    Herbert Spencer advances a theory that non-logical actions alone influence
    society. "Ideas do not govern and overthrow the world: the world is governed
    or overthrown by feelings,
    to which ideas serve only as guides. The social mechanism does not rest
    finally upon opinions; but almost wholly upon character. Not intellectual
    anarchy, but moral antagonism, is the cause of political crises. All social
    phenomena are produced by the totality of human emotions and beliefs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Practically, the popular character, and the social state, determine what
    ideas shall be current; instead of the current ideas determining the social
    state and the character. The modification of men's moral natures caused by
    the continuous discipline of social life, which adapts them more and more to
    social relations, is therefore the chief proximate cause of social
    progress."<sup><a href="#footnote-0285-01" id="ref-0285-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0286">
    <strong>286.</strong>
    Then a curious thing happens: Comte and Spencer reverse positions
    reciprocally! In his <i>System of Positive Polity,</i> Vol. IV, p. 5, Comte decides
    to allow sentiment to prevail, and expresses himself very clearly on the
    point: "Though I have always proclaimed the universal preponderance of
    sentiment, I have had, so far, to devote my attention primarily to
    intelligence and activity, which prevail in sociology. But the very real
    ascendancy they have acquired having now brought on the period of their real
    systematization, the final purpose of this volume must now be to bring about
    a definite predominance of sentiment, which is the essential domain of
    morality."
  </p>
  <p>
    Comte is straining the truth a little when he says that he has <em>"always</em>
    proclaimed the universal preponderance of sentiment." No trace of any such
    preponderance is to be detected in his <i>Cours.</i> Ideas stand in the forefront
    there. But Comte has changed. He began by considering existing theories,
    which he wished to replace with others of his own make; and in that battle
    of ideas, his own naturally won the palm, and from them new life was to come
    to the world. But time rolls on. Comte becomes a prophet. The battle of
    ideas is over. He imagines he has won a complete victory. So now he begins
    proclaiming dogma, pronouncing <i>ex cathedra,</i> and it is only natural that
    nothing but sentiments should now be left on the field&mdash;his own
    sentiments, of course.<sup><a href="#footnote-0286-01" id="ref-0286-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0287">
    <strong>287.</strong>
    Comte, moreover, began by hoping to make converts of people; and
    naturally the instrument for doing that was, at the time, ideas. But he
    ended by having no hope save in a religion imposed by force, imposed if need
    be by Czar Nicholas, by the Sultan, or at the very least by a Louis Napoleon
    (who would in fact have done better to rest content with being just a
    dictator in the service of Positivism).<sup><a href="#footnote-0287-01" id="ref-0287-01">1</a></sup> In this scheme
    sentiment is the big
    thing beyond shadow of doubt, and one can no longer say that "ideas govern
    or upset the world." It would be absurd to suppose that Comte turned to the
    Czar, to Reshid Pasha, or to Louis Napoleon, to induce them merely to preach
    ideas to their peoples. One might only object that the ideas of Comte would
    be determining the religion which would later be imposed upon mankind; and
    in that case ideas would be "upsetting the world," if the Czar, the Sultan,
    Louis Napoleon, or some other well-intentioned despot saw fit to take charge
    of enforcing Comte's positivism upon mankind. But that is far from being the meaning one gathers from the statements
    in the <i>Cours.</i>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0288">
    <strong>288.</strong>
    Comte recognizes, in fact he greatly exaggerates, the social influence
    of public worship and its efficacy in education&mdash;all of which is just a
    particular case of the efficacy of non-logical impulses. If Comte could have
    rested satisfied with being just a scientist, he might have written an
    excellent book on the value of religions and taught us many things. But he
    wanted to be the prophet of a new religion. Instead of studying the effects
    of historical or existing forms of worship, he wanted to create a new
    one&mdash;an entirely different matter. So he gives just another
    illustration of the harm done to science by the mania for practical
    applications.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0289">
    <strong>289.</strong>
    Spencer, on the other hand, after admitting, even too sweepingly, the
    influence of non-logical actions, eliminates them altogether by the general
    procedure described in § <a href="#section-0261">261</a>. Says he: "Our postulate must be that primitive
    ideas are natural, and, under the conditions in which they occur, rational."<sup><a href="#footnote-0289-01"
        id="ref-0289-01">1</a></sup> Driven out by the door, logic here climbs back through the window. "In
    early life we have been taught that human nature is everywhere the same.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This error we must
    replace by the truth that the laws of thought are
    everywhere the same; and that, given the data as known to him, the primitive
    man's inference is the reasonable inference" (§§ <a href="#section-0701">701</a>, <a href="#section-0711">711</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0290">
    <strong>290.</strong>
    In assuming any such thing, Spencer puts himself in the wrong in his
    controversy with Comte. If human beings always draw logical inferences from
    the data they have before them, and if they act in accordance with such
    inferences, then we are left with nothing but logical conduct, and it is
    ideas that "govern or upset the world." There is no room left for those
    sentiments to which Spencer was disposed to attribute that capacity; there
    is no way for them to crowd into a ready-made aggregate composed of
    experimental facts, however badly observed, and of logical inferences
    derived from such facts.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0291">
    <strong>291.</strong>
    The principle advanced by Spencer makes sociology very easy, especially
    if it be combined with two other Spencerian principles: unitary evolution,
    and the identity, or quasi-identity, of the
    savages of our time with primitive man (§§ <a href="#section-0728">728</a>, <a href="#section-0731">731</a>).
    Accounts by travellers,
    more or less accurate and more or less soundly interpreted, give us, Spencer
    thinks, the data that primitive man had at his disposal; and where such
    accounts fail, we fill in the gaps with our imagination, which, when it
    cannot get the real, takes the plausible. That gives us all we need for a
    sociology, for we have only to determine the logical implications of the
    data at hand, without wasting too much time on long and difficult historical
    researches.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0292">
    <strong>292.</strong>
    In just that way Spencer sets about discovering the origin and
    evolution of religion. His primitive man is like a modern scientist working
    in a laboratory to frame a theory. Primitive man of course has very
    imperfect materials at his disposal. That is why, despite his logical
    thinking, he can reach only imperfect conclusions. All the same he gets some
    philosophical notions that are not a little subtle. Spencer, <i>Ibid.,</i> Vol. I,
    § 154, represents as a "primitive" idea the notion that "any property
    characterizing an aggregate inheres in all parts of it." If you are desirous
    of testing the validity of that theory you need only state the proposition
    to some moderately educated individual among your friends, and you will see
    at once that he will not have the remotest idea of what you are talking
    about. Yet Spencer, <i>loc. cit.,</i> believes that your friend will go on and draw
    logical conclusions from something he does not understand: "The soul,
    present in the body of the dead man preserved entire, is also present in
    preserved parts of his body. Hence the faith in relics." Surely Spencer
    could never have discussed that subject with some good Catholic peasant
    woman on the Continent. The argument he maps out might possibly lead a
    philosopher enamoured of logic to believe in relics, but it has nothing
    whatever to do with popular beliefs in relics.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0293">
    <strong>293.</strong>
    So Spencer's procedure has points of similarity with Comte's procedure.
    In general terms, one might state the situation in this fashion: we have two
    things, <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> (Figure 8), that have to be considered in determining the
    social order <i>R.</i> We begin by asserting that <i>Q</i> alone determines that order;
    then we show that <i>P</i> determines <i>Q.</i> So <i>Q</i> is eliminated, and <i>P</i> alone determines
    the social order.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0294">
    <strong>294.</strong>
    If <i>Q</i> designates "ideas" and <i>P</i> "sentiments," we get, roughly, the
    evolution of Comte's theories. If <i>Q</i> designates "sentiments" and <i>P</i> "ideas,"
    we get, roughly, the evolution of Spencer's theories.

    That is confirmed by the remarks of John Stuart Mill on the controversy
    between Comte and Spencer. Says he:<sup><a href="#footnote-0295-01" id="ref-0295-01">1</a></sup> "It will not be
    found, on a fair
    examination of what M. Comte has written, that he has overlooked any of the
    truth that there is in Mr. Spencer's theory. He would not indeed have said
    (what Mr. Spencer apparently wishes us to say) that the effects which can be
    historically traced, for example, to religion, were not produced by the
    belief in God, but by reverence and fear of Him. He would have said that the
    reverence and fear presuppose the belief: that a God must be
    believed in before he can be feared or reverenced."
    That is the very procedure in question! <i>P</i> is the belief in God; <i>Q,</i>
    sentiments of fear and reverence; <i>P</i> produces <i>Q,</i> and so becomes the cause
    determining conduct!

    <strong>296.</strong>
    To a perfect logician like Mill it seems absurd that anyone could
    experience fear unless the feeling be logically inferred from a subject
    capable of inspiring fear. He should have remembered the verse of Statius,

  <blockquote>
    <i>"Primus in orbe deos fecit timor,"</i><sup><a href="#footnote-0296-01" id="ref-0296-01">1</a></sup>
  </blockquote>

  and then he would have seen that a course diametrically opposite is
  perfectly conceivable.<sup><a href="#footnote-0296-02" id="ref-0296-02">2</a></sup>
  That granted, what was the course pursued
  in reality? Or better, what were the various courses pursued? It is for
  historical documents to answer, and we cannot let our fancy take the place
  of documents and pass off as real anything that seems plausible to us. We
  have to know how things actually took place, and not how they should have
  taken place, in order to satisfy a strictly logical
  intelligence.<sup><a href="#footnote-0296-03" id="ref-0296-03">3</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0297">
    <strong>297.</strong>
    In other connexions, Mill is perfectly well aware of the social
    importance of non-logical actions. But he at once withdraws the concession,
    in part at least, and instead of going on with what is, turns to
    speculations as to what ought to be. That is the general procedure; and many
    writers resort to it to be rid of non-logical conduct.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0298">
    <strong>298.</strong>
    In his book <i>On Liberty,</i> p. 16, Mill writes, for example: "Men's
    opinions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on what is laudable or blameable, are affected by all the
    multifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the conduct of
    others, and which are as numerous as those which determine their wishes on
    any other subject: sometimes their reason&mdash;at other times their
    prejudices or superstitions: often their social affections, not seldom their
    antisocial ones, their envy or jealousy, their arrogance or
    contemptuousness: but most commonly, their desires or fears for
    themselves&mdash;their legitimate or illegitimate self-interest. Wherever
    there is an ascendant class, a large portion of the morality of the country
    emanates from its class interests, and its feelings of class superiority."
  </p>
  <p>
    All that, with a few reservations, is well said and approximately pictures
    the facts.<sup><a href="#footnote-0298-01" id="ref-0298-01">1</a></sup>
    Mill might have gone on in that direction, and inquired, since
    he was dealing with liberty, into the relations of liberty to the motives he
    assigns to human conduct. In that event, he might have made a discovery: he
    might have seen that he was involved in a contradiction in trying with all
    his might to transfer political power to "the greatest number," while at the
    same time
    defending a "liberty" that was incompatible with the prejudices, sentiments,
    and interests of said "greatest number." That discovery would then have
    enabled him to make a prophecy&mdash;one of the fundamental functions of
    science; namely, to foresee that liberty, as he conceived it, was
    progressively to decline, as being contrary to the motives that he had
    established as determinants of the aspirations of the class which was about
    to become the ruling class.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0299">
    <strong>299.</strong>
    But Mill thought less of things as they are than of things as they
    ought to be. He says, <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 22: "He [a man] cannot rightfully be
    compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so,
    because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do
    so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating
    with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but
    not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do
    otherwise."<sup><a href="#footnote-0299-01" id="ref-0299-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    That may be a "good justice," but it is not the justice handed out to us by
    our masters, who each year favour us with new laws to prevent our doing the
    very things that Mill says people should be allowed to do. His preaching,
    therefore, has been altogether without effect.

    In certain writers the part played by non-logical actions is suppressed
    altogether, or rather, is regarded merely as the exceptional part, the "bad"
    part. Logic alone is a means to human progress. It is synonymous with
    "good," just as all that is not logical is synonymous with "evil." But let
    us not be led astray by the word "logic." Belief in logic has nothing to do
    with logico-experimental science; and the worship of Reason may stand on a
    par with any other religious cult, fetishism not excepted.

    Condorcet expresses himself as
    follows:<sup><a href="#footnote-0301-01" id="ref-0301-01">1</a></sup>
    "So a general knowledge of the
    natural rights of man; the opinion, even, that such rights are inalienable
    and unprescribable; a prayer voiced aloud for liberty of thought and press,
    for freedom of commerce and industry, for succour of the people&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    indifference to all religions &mdash;classified, at last, where they belong
    with superstitions and political devices [The good soul fails to notice that
    his worship of Progress is itself a religion!]&mdash;hatred and hypocrisy
    and fanaticism; contempt for prejudices; zeal for the propagation of
    enlightenment&mdash;all became the common avowal, the distinguishing mark,
    of anyone who was neither a Machiavellian nor a fool." Preaching
    religious toleration, Condorcet is not aware that he is betraying an
    intolerance of his own when he treats dissenters from his religion of
    Progress the way the orthodox have always treated heretics. It is true that
    he considers himself right and his adversaries wrong, because his own
    religion is good and theirs bad; but that, inverting terms, is exactly what
    they say too.

    Maxims from Condorcet and other writers of his time are still quoted by
    humanitarian fanatics today. Condorcet continues, p. 292: "All errors in
    politics and morals are based on philosophical errors, which are in turn
    connected with errors in physic. There is no religious system, no
    supernatural extravagance, that is not grounded on ignorance of the laws of
    nature." But he himself gives proof of just such ignorance when he tries to
    have us swallow absurdities like the following, p. 345: "What vicious
    practice is there, what custom contrary to good faith, nay, what crime, that
    cannot be shown to have its cause and origin in the laws, the institutions,
    the prejudices, of the country in which that practice, that custom, is
    observed, that crime committed?" And he concludes finally, p. 346, that
    "nature links truth, happiness, and virtue with chain unsunderable."

    Similar ideas are common among the French <i>philosophes</i> of the later
    eighteenth century. In their eyes every blessing doth from "reason" flow,
    every ill from "superstition." Holbach sees the source of all human woe in
    error;<sup><a href="#footnote-0303-01" id="ref-0303-01">1</a></sup>
    and that belief has endured as one of
    the dogmas of the humanitarian religion, holiest of holies, of which our

    All these people fail to notice that the worship of "Reason," "Truth,"
    "Progress," and other similar entities is, like all cults, to be classed
    with non-logical actions. It was born, it has flourished, and it continues
    to prosper, for the purpose of combating other cults, just as in
    Graeco-Roman society the oriental cults arose out of opposition to the
    polytheistic cult. At that time one same current of non-logical conduct
    found its multiple expression in the <i>taurobolium,</i> the <i>criobolium,</i> the cult
    of Mithras, the growing importance of mysteries, Neo-Platonism, mysticism,
    and finally Christianity, which was to triumph over rival cults, none the
    less borrowing many things from them. So, toward the end of the eighteenth
    century and the beginning of the nineteenth, one same current of non-logical
    conduct finds its expression in the theism of the <i>philosophes,</i> the
    sentimental vagaries of Rousseau, the cult of "Reason" and the "Supreme
    Being," the love of the First Republic for the number 10, theophilanthropy
    (of which the "positivist" religion of Comte is merely an offshoot), the
    religion of Saint-Simon, the religion of pacifism, and other religions that
    still survive to our times.

  <p>
    These considerations belong to a much more comprehensive order, properly
    relating to the <em>subjective</em> aspect of theories indicated in § <a href="01.html#section-0013">13</a>. In
    general,
    in other words, we have to ask ourselves why and how individuals come to
    evolve and accept certain theories. And, in particular, now that we have
    identified one such purpose&mdash;the purpose of giving logical status to
    conduct that does not possess it&mdash;we have to ask by what means and
    devices that purpose is achieved. From the objective standpoint, the error
    in the arguments
    just noted lies in their giving an <i>a priori</i> answer to the questions stated
    in § <a href="01.html#section-0014">14</a>, and in maintaining that a theory needs simply to be in accord with
    the facts to be advantageous to society. That error is usually supplemented
    by the further error of considering facts not as they stand in reality but
    as they are pictured by the exhilarated imagination of the enthusiast.

    Our induction so far has shown from some few particular cases the
    prevalence of a tendency to evade consideration of non-logical actions, which

    discuss human societies; and also the no mean importance of that tendency.

    So let us now examine the various devices by which non-logical actions
    are eliminated so that only logical actions are left: and suppose we begin
    as usual by classifying the objects we are trying to understand.
  </p>
  <h3>Class A<sup><a href="#footnote-0306-01" id="ref-0306-01">1</a></sup></h3>
  <p>
    The principles<sup><a href="#footnote-0306-02" id="ref-0306-02">2</a></sup>
    underlying non-logical actions are held to be devoid of any
    objective reality (§§ <a href="#section-0307">307</a>-18).
  </p>
  <h4>Genera</h4>
  <p><i>Genus</i> I. They are disregarded entirely (§§ <a href="#section-0307">307</a>-08).</p>
  <p><i>Genus</i> II. They are regarded as absurd prejudices (§§ <a href="#section-0309">309</a>-11)</p>
  <p>
    <i>Genus</i> III.
    They are regarded as tricks used by some individuals to deceive others
    (§§ <a href="#section-0312">312</a>-18)
  </p>
  <h3>Class B</h3>
  <p>
    The principles underlying non-logical actions are credited with now more,
    now less, objective reality (§§ <a href="#section-0319">319</a>-51)
  </p>
  <h4>Genera and Subgenera</h4>
  <p><i>Genus</i> I. The principles are taken as completely and directly real (§§ <a href="#section-0319">319</a>-38)
  </p>
  <p class="subparagraph">
    I<i>α</i>. Precepts with sanctions in part imaginary (§§ <a href="#section-0321">321</a>-33)
  </p>
  <p class="subparagraph">
    I<i>β</i>. Simple
    interposition of a personal god or a personified abstraction (§§ <a href="#section-0332">332</a>-33)
  </p>
  <p class="subparagraph">I<i>γ</i>.
    The same interposition supplemented by legends and logical
    inferences (§ <a href="#section-0334">334</a>)
  </p>
  <p class="subparagraph">I<i>δ</i>. Some metaphysical entity is taken as real (§§ <a href="#section-0335">335</a>-36)
  </p>
  <p class="subparagraph">I<i>ε</i>. What is real is an implicit accord between the principles and certain
    sentiments (§§ <a href="#section-0337">337</a>-38)
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Genus</i> II. The principles of non-logical conduct are not taken as completely
    or directly real. Indirectly, the reality is found in
    certain facts that are said to be inaccurately observed or imperfectly
    understood (§§ <a href="#section-0339">339</a>-50)
  </p>
  <p class="subparagraph">
    II<i>α</i>. It is assumed that human beings make imperfect observations, and derive
    inferences from them logically (§§ <a href="#section-0340">340</a>-46)
  </p>
  <p class="subparagraph">
    II<i>β</i>. A myth is taken as the reflection of some historical reality that is
    concealed in one way or another, or else as a mere imitation of some other
    myth (§§ <a href="#section-0347">347</a>-49)
  </p>
  <p class="subparagraph">
    II<i>γ</i>. A myth is made up of two parts: a historical fact and
    an imaginary adjunct (§ <a href="#section-0350">350</a>)
  </p>
  <p><i>Genus</i> III. The principles of non-logical
    actions are mere allegories (§§ <a href="#section-0351">351</a>-52)
  </p>
  <h3>Class C</h3>
  <p>
    It is assumed that non-logical actions have no effect on "progress," or else
    are obstructive to it. Hence they are to be eliminated in any study designed
    solely to promote "progress" (§§ <a href="#section-0353">353</a>-56).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0307">
    <strong>307.</strong>
    Let us examine these various categories one by one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Device A-I: <i>Non-logical actions are disregarded.</i> Non-logical actions can be
    disregarded entirely as having no place in the realm of reality. That is the
    position of Plato's Socrates in the matter of the national religions of
    Greece.<sup><a href="#footnote-0307-01" id="ref-0307-01">1</a></sup>
    He is asked what he thinks of the ravishing of Orithyia, daughter
    of Erechtheus, by Boreas. He begins by rejecting the logical interpretation
    that tries to see a historical fact in the myth (II<i>γ</i>). Then he opines that
    such inquiries are as finespun as they are profitless, and falls back on the
    popular belief. On common belief the oracle at Delphi also relied when it
    prescribed that the best way to honour the gods was for each to follow the
    customs of his own
    city.<sup><a href="#footnote-0307-02" id="ref-0307-02">2</a></sup>
    Certainly the oracle in no wise meant by that
    that such customs corresponded to things that were not real; yet actually
    they might as well have, since they were held to be entirely exempt from the
    verification to which real things are considered subject. That method often
    amounts to viewing beliefs as non-logical actions to be taken for what they
    are without any attempt to explain them&mdash;the problem being merely to
    discover the relationship in which they stand towards other social facts.
    That, overtly or tacitly, is the attitude of many statesmen.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0308">
    <strong>308.</strong>
    So, in Cicero's <i>De natura deorum,</i> the pontifex Cotta distinguishes the
    statesman from the philosopher. As pontifex he protests that he will ever
    defend the beliefs, the worship, the ceremonies, the religion, of the
    forefathers, and that no argument, be it of scholar or dunce, will ever
    budge him from that position. He is persuaded that Romulus and Numa founded
    Rome, the one with his auspices, the other with his religion. "That, Balbus,
    is what I think, as Cotta and as pontifex. It is now for me to know what you
    think. From you, a philosopher, I have a right to expect some reason for
    your beliefs. The beliefs I get from our forefathers I must accept quite
    apart from any
    proof."<sup><a href="#footnote-0308-01" id="ref-0308-01">1</a></sup>
    In that it is obvious that as pontifex Cotta
    deliberately steps aside from the realm of logical reality, which implies a
    belief either that traditional Roman beliefs have no basis in fact or else
    that they are to be classed with non-logical actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-0308-02" id="ref-0308-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0309">
    <strong>309.</strong>
    Device A-II: <i>The principles of non-logical actions are regarded as
      absurd prejudices.</i> One may consider merely the forms of non-logical actions
    and finding them irrational, judge them absurd prejudices, at the most
    deserving of attention from a pathological
    standpoint as veritable maladies of the human race. That has been the
    attitude of not a few writers in dealing with legal and political
    formalities. It is the attitude especially of writers on religion and most
    of all of writers on forms of worship. It is also the attitude of our
    contemporary anti-clericals with regard to the Christian religion&mdash;and
    it betrays great ignorance on the part of those bigots, along with a
    narrow-mindedness that incapacitates them for ever understanding social
    phenomena.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have already seen specimens of this type of reasoning in the works of
    Condorcet (§§ <a href="#section-0301">301</a>-02) and Holbach (§§
    <a href="#footnote-0296-02">296<sup>2</sup></a>, <a href="#section-0303">303</a>).
    A more diluted type is
    observable in disquisitions purporting to make this or that religion "more
    scientific" (§ <a href="01.html#footnote-0016-02">16<sup>2</sup></a>),
    on the assumption that a religion which is not
    scientific is either absurd or reprehensible. So in earlier times there were
    efforts to remove by subtle interpretation such elements in the legends and
    cults of the pagan gods as were considered non-logical. It was the procedure
    of the Protestants during the Reformation, while the liberal Protestants of
    our day are repeating the same exploits, appealing to their pseudo-science.
    So also for the Modernists in their criticism of Catholicism, and for our
    Radical Socialists in their demeanour towards Marxism.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0310">
    <strong>310.</strong>
    If one regards certain non-logical actions as absurd, one may centre
    chiefly on their ridiculous aspects; and that is often an effective weapon
    for combating a faith. Frequent use of it was made against established
    religions from the day of Lucian down to the day of Voltaire. In an article
    replete with historical blunders, Voltaire says of the religion of Rome: "I
    am imagining that after conquering Egypt Caesar sends an embassy to China,
    with the idea of stimulating the foreign trade of the Roman Empire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    The Emperor Iventi, first of that name, is reigning at the time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After
    receiving Caesar's ambassadors with typical Chinese courtesy, he secretly
    inquires through his interpreters as to the civilization, customs, and
    religion of these Romans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He learns that the Roman People supports at
    great expense a college of priests, who can tell you exactly the right time
    for embarking on a voyage and the very best place for fighting a battle by
    inspecting the liver of an ox or the
    appetite with which chickens eat their barley. That sacred science was
    brought to the Romans long, long before by a little god named Tages, who was
    unearthed somewhere in Tuscany. The Roman people worship just one god whom
    they always call 'Highest and Best.' All the same, they have built a temple
    to a harlot named Flora; and most Roman housewives have little household
    gods in their homes, five or six inches high. One of the little divinities
    is the goddess Nipples, another the god Bottom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Emperor has his
    laugh. The courts at Nanking at first conclude, as he does, that the Roman
    ambassadors are either lunatics or impostors&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but the Emperor, being as
    just as he is courteous, holds private converse with the ambassadors.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    They confess to him that the College of Augurs dates from early ages of
    Roman barbarism; that an institution so ridiculous has been allowed to
    survive only because it became endeared to the people in the course of long
    ages; that all respectable people make fun of the augurs; that Caesar never
    consults them; that according to a very great man by the name of Cato no
    augur is ever able to speak to a colleague without a laugh; and finally that
    Cicero, the greatest orator and best philosopher of Rome, has just published
    against the augurs a little essay, <i>On Divination,</i> in which he hands over to
    everlasting ridicule all auspices, all prophecy, and all the fortune-telling
    of which humanity is enamoured. The Emperor of China is curious to read
    Cicero's essay. His interpreters translate it. He admires the book and the
    Roman Republic."<sup><a href="#footnote-0310-01" id="ref-0310-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0311">
    <strong>311.</strong>
    In dealing with writings of this kind, we must be careful not to fall
    into the very error we are here considering, with reference to non-logical
    actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-0311-01" id="ref-0311-01">1</a></sup>
    The intrinsic value of such satires may be zero when viewed from
    the experimental standpoint, whereas their polemical value may be great.
    Those two things we must always keep distinct. Moreover they may have a
    certain intrinsic value: a group of non-logical actions taken as a whole may
    be useful for attaining a given purpose without absolutely all of them,
    taken individually, being useful to that purpose. Certain ridiculous actions
    may be eliminated from such a group without impairing its effectiveness.
    However, in so reasoning we must beware of falling into the fallacy of the
    man who said he could lose all his hair without becoming bald because he
    could lose any particular hair without suffering that catastrophe.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0312">
    <strong>312.</strong>
    Device A-III: <i>Non-logical actions as tricks for deceit.</i> After
    establishing, as in the two cases above, that certain actions are not
    logical, but still resolved to have them such in the feeling that every
    human act should be born of logic, a writer may go on and say that an
    institution involving non-logical conduct is an invention of this or that
    individual or group that is designed to procure some personal advantage,
    or some advantage to state, society, or humanity at large. So actions
    intrinsically non-logical are transformed into actions that are logical from
    the standpoint of the end in view.
  </p>
  <p>
    To adopt this procedure as regards actions deemed beneficial to society is
    to depart from the extreme case noted in § <a href="01.html#section-0014">14</a>,
    where it is maintained that
    only theories which accord with facts (logico-experimental theories) can be
    beneficial to society. It is here recognized that there are theories which
    are not logico-experimental, but which are nevertheless beneficial to
    society. All the same, the writer cannot make up his mind to admit that such
    theories derive spontaneously from non-logical impulse. No, all conduct has
    to be logical. Therefore such theories too are products of logical
    actions. These actions cannot originate in the sources of the theories,
    since it has been recognized that the theories have no experimental basis;
    but they may envisage the same purposes as the theories, which experience
    shows are beneficial to society. So we get the following solution:
    "Theories not in accord with the facts may be beneficial to society and are
    therefore logically <em>invented</em> to that
    end."<sup><a href="#footnote-0312-01" id="ref-0312-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0313">
    <strong>313.</strong>
    The notion that non-logical actions have been logically devised to
    attain certain purposes has been held by many many writers. Even Polybius, a
    historian of great sagacity, speaks of the religion
    of the Romans as originating in deliberate artifice.<sup><a href="#footnote-0313-01" id="ref-0313-01">1</a></sup>

    We may take Montesquieu's view of Roman religion as the type of the
    interpretation here in question.<sup><a href="#footnote-0314-01" id="ref-0314-01">1</a></sup>
    "Neither fear nor piety established
    religion among the Romans, but the same necessity that compels all societies
    to have religions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I note this difference, however, between Roman
    legislators and the lawgivers of other peoples, that the Romans created
    religion for the State, the others the State for religion. Romulus, Tatius,
    and Numa made the gods servants of statesmanship; and the cult and the
    ceremonies that they instituted were found to be so wise that when the kings
    were expelled the yoke of religion was the only one which that people dared
    not throw off in its frenzy for liberty. In establishing religion, Roman
    law-makers were not at all thinking of reforming morals or proclaiming moral
    principles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They had at first only a general view, to inspire a people
    that feared nothing with fear of the gods, and to use that fear to lead it
    whithersoever they pleased.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was in truth going pretty far to stake
    the safety of the State on the sacred appetite of a chicken and the
    disposition of the entrails in a sacrificial animal; but the founders of
    those ceremonies were well aware of their strong and weak points, and it was
    not without good reasons that they sinned against reason itself. Had that
    form of worship been more rational, the educated as well as the plain man
    would have been deceived by it; and so all the advantage to be expected from
    it would have been lost."

    The variety of interpretation here in question sometimes contains
    an element of truth, not as regards the origin of non-logical actions,
    but as regards the purposes to which they may be turned once they have
    become customary. Then it is natural enough that the shrewd should use them
    for their own ends just as they use any other force in society. The error
    lies in assuming that such forces have been invented by design (§ <a href="#section-0312">312</a>). An
    example from our own time may bring out the point more clearly. There are
    plenty of rogues, surely, who make their profit out of spiritualism; but it
    would be absurd to imagine that spiritualism originated as a mere scheme of
    rogues.

    Van Dale, in his treatise <i>De Oraculis,</i> saw nothing but artifice in the
    pagan oracles. That notion belongs with this group of interpretations.
    Eusebius wavers between it and the view that oracles were the work of
    devils.<sup><a href="#footnote-0317-01" id="ref-0317-01">1</a></sup>
    Such mixtures of interpretations are common. We shall come back to

    Likewise with this variety are to be classed interpretations that
    regard non-logical actions as consequences of an external or exoteric
    doctrine serving to conceal an internal or esoteric doctrine. That would
    make actions which are non-logical in appearance logical in reality.
    Consider a passage in Galileo's <i>Dialogue of the Greater Systems</i> (Salviati
    speaking):<sup><a href="#footnote-0318-01" id="ref-0318-01">1</a></sup>
    "That the Pythagoreans held the science of numbers in very high
    esteem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am well aware, nor would I be loath to concur in that judgment.
    But that the mysteries in view of which Pythagoras and his sect held the
    science of numbers in such great veneration are the absurdities commonly
    current in books and conversation, I can in no way agree. On the contrary,
    they did not care to have their wonders exposed to the ridicule and
    disparagement of the common herd. So they damned as sacrilegious any
    publication of the more recondite properties of the numbers and
    incommensurable and irrational quantities with which they dealt, and they
    preached that anyone disclosing such things would suffer torment in the
    world to come. I think that some of
    them, to throw a sop to the vulgar and be free of prying importunity,
    represented their numeral mysteries as the same childish idiocies that later
    on spread generally abroad. It was a shrewd and cunning device on their
    part, like the trick of that sagacious young man who escaped the prying of
    his mother (or his curious wife&mdash;I forget which), who was pressing him
    to confide the secrets of the Senate, by making up a story wherewith she and
    other prattling females proceeded to make fools of themselves, to the great
    amusement of the Sentaors."
  </p>
  <p>
    That the Pythagoreans sometimes misrepresented their own doctrines seems
    certain; but it is not at all apparent that that was the case with their
    ideas on perfect numbers. On that point Galileo is mistaken
    (§§ <a href="06.html#section-0960">960</a> f.).

    This variety is exemplified by non-logical actions of a religious character
    on the part of unquestioning believers. Such actions differ little if at all
    from logical actions. If a person is convinced that to be sure of a good
    voyage he must sacrifice to Poseidon and sail in a ship that does not leak,
    he will perform the sacrifice and caulk his seams in exactly the same

    Curiously enough, such doctrines come closer than any others to a

    appendage that asserts the reality of an imaginary principle; whereas many

    differ from scientific doctrines by inferences that are either fantastic or
    devoid of all exactness.

    Device B-I<i>α</i>: <i>Precept plus sanction.</i> This variety is obtained by
    appending some adjunct or other to the simple sanctionless precept&mdash;to
    the taboo (<i>cf.</i> §

    Reinach writes:<sup><a href="#footnote-0322-01" id="ref-0322-01">1</a></sup>
    "A taboo is an interdiction; an object that is taboo,
    or tabooed, is a forbidden object. The interdiction may forbid corporal
    contact or visual contact; it may also exempt the object from the peculiar
    kind of violation involved in pronouncing its name.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Similar
    interdictions are observable in Greece and Rome, and among many other
    peoples, where generally it is explained that knowledge of a name enables a
    person to 'evoke' with evil intent the 'power' that the name designates.
    That explanation may have been valid at certain periods; but it does not
    represent the primitive state of mind. Originally it was the sanctity of the
    name itself that was dreaded, on the same grounds as contact with a tabooed
    object."
  </p>
  <p>
    Reinach is right in regarding as an appendage the notion that knowledge of
    the name of an object gives a person power over it; but the notion of
    sanctity is likewise an appendage. Indeed, probably few of the individuals
    observing a taboo would know what was meant by an abstraction such as
    "sanctity." For them the taboo is just a non-logical action, just an
    <em>aversion</em> to touching, looking at, naming, the thing tabooed. Later on an
    effort is made to explain or justify the aversion; and then the mysterious
    power of which Reinach speaks (or perhaps his own notion of sanctity) is
    invented.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reinach continues: "The notion of the taboo is narrower still than the
    notion of interdiction. The characteristic difference is that the taboo
    never gives a reason." That is excellent! The non-logical action has just
    that trait. But for that very reason Reinach should not, in a particular
    case, provide the taboo with a reason in some consideration of sanctity. He
    goes on: "The prohibition is merely stated, taking the cause for
    granted&mdash;it is, in fact, nothing but the taboo itself, that is to say,
    the assertion of a mortal peril." But in saying that he is withdrawing his
    concession and trying to edge back into the domain of logic. No "cause" is
    taken for granted! The taboo lies in a pure and absolute repugnance to doing
    a certain thing. To get something similar from our own world: There is the
    sentimental person who could never be induced to cut off a chicken's head.
    There is no "cause" for the aversion; it is just an aversion, and it is
    strong enough to keep the person from cutting off a chicken's head! It is
    not apparent either why Reinach would have it that the penalty for violating
    a taboo is always a mortal peril. He himself gives examples to the contrary.
    Going on, he returns to the domain of non-logical actions, well observing
    that "the taboos that have come down into contemporary cultures are often
    stated with supporting reasons. But such reasons have been excogitated in
    times relatively recent [One could not say better.] and bear the stamp of
    modern ideas. For example, people will say, 'Speak softly in a chamber of
    death [A taboo that gives no evidence of having a "mortal peril" for a
    sanction.] out of respect for the dead.' The primitive taboo lay in avoiding
    not only contact with a corpse, but its very proximity. [Still no evidence
    of any mortal peril.] Nevertheless even today, in educating children taboos
    are imparted without stated reasons, or else with some mere specification of
    the general character of the interdiction: 'Do not take off your coat in
    company, for that is not nice.' In his <i>Works and Days,</i> v. 727, Hesiod
    interdicts passing water with one's face towards the sun, but he gives no
    reasons for the prohibition. [A pure non-logical action.] Most taboos
    relating to decorum have come down across the centuries without
    justifications" [and with no threats of "mortal
    peril"].<sup><a href="#footnote-0322-02" id="ref-0322-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0323">
    <strong>323.</strong>
    With taboos may profitably be classed other things of the kind where
    logical interpretation is reduced to a minimum. William Marsden says of the
    Mohammedans of
    Sumatra:<sup><a href="#footnote-0323-01" id="ref-0323-01">1</a></sup>
    "Many who profess to follow it [Mohammedanism] give
    themselves not the least concern about its injunctions, or even know what
    they require. A Malay at Marina upbraided a countryman, with the total
    ignorance of religion, his nation laboured under, 'You pay a veneration to
    the tombs of your ancestors: what foundation have you for supposing that
    your dead ancestors can lend you assistance?' 'It may be true,' answered the
    other; 'but what foundation have <i>you,</i> for expecting
    assistance from Allah and Mahomet?' 'Are you not aware,' replied the Malay,
    'that it is written in a Book? Have you not heard of the Koraan?' The
    native of the Passumah, with conscious inferiority, submitted to the force
    of this
    argument."<sup><a href="#footnote-0323-02" id="ref-0323-02">2</a></sup>
    That is a seed which will sprout and yield an abundant
    harvest of logical interpretations, some of which we shall find in the
    devices hereafter following.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0324">
    <strong>324.</strong>
    Something like the taboo is the precept
    (§§ <a href="02.html#section-0154">154</a>, <a href="09.html#section-1480">1480</a> f.).
    It may be
    given without sanction, "Do so and so," and in that form it is a plain
    non-logical action. In the injunction, "You <em>ought</em> to do so and so," there is
    a slight, sometimes a very slight, trace of explanation. It lurks in the
    term "ought," which suggests the mysterious entity Duty. That is often
    supplemented by a sanction real or imaginary, and then we get actions that
    are either actually logical or else are merely made to appear so. Only a
    certain number of precepts, therefore, can be properly grouped with the
    things we are classifying here.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0325">
    <strong>325.</strong>
    In general, precepts may be distinguished as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>a. Pure precept, without stated reasons, and without proof.</i> The proposition
    is not elliptical. No proof is given, either because no proof exists or
    because none is asked for. That, therefore, is the pure non-logical action.
    But human beings have such a passion for logical explanations that they
    usually stick one or two on, no matter how silly. "Do that!" is a precept.
    If it be asked, "Why should I do that?" the answer is, let us say, "Because
    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!" or, "Because it is customary." The logical appendage is of little
    value, except where violation of custom implies some penalty&mdash;but in
    that case the penalty, not the custom, carries the logical force.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0326">
    <strong>326.</strong>
    <i>b. The demonstration is elliptical.</i> The proof, valid or not, is
    available. It has not been mentioned, but it may be. The proposition is a
    precept only in appearance. The terms "ought," "must," and the like may be
    suppressed, and the precept reduced to an experimental or
    pseudo-experimental theorem, the consequence deriving from the act without
    any interposition from without. This type of precept runs, "To get <i>A,</i> you
    must do <i>B,"</i>; or, negatively, "To
    avoid <i>A,</i> you must refrain from doing <i>B."</i> The first proposition can be stated
    thus: "When <i>B</i> is done, <i>A</i> results." Similarly for the second.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0327">
    <strong>327.</strong>
    If both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are real things and if the nexus between them is
    actually logico-experimental, we get scientific propositions. They have
    nothing to do with the things we are trying to classify here. If the nexus
    is not logico-experimental, they are pseudo-scientific propositions, and a
    certain number of them are used to logicalize non-logical actions. For
    instance, if <i>A</i> stands for a safe voyage and <i>B</i> for sacrifices to Poseidon,
    the nexus is imaginary, and the non-logical action <i>B</i> is justified by the
    nexus that connects it with <i>A.</i> But if <i>A</i> stands for a safe voyage and <i>B</i> for
    defective ship-building, we get just an erroneous scientific proposition. A
    mistake in engineering is not a non-logical action.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0328">
    <strong>328.</strong>
    If <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are both imaginary, we are wholly outside the experimental
    field, and we need not consider such propositions. If <i>A</i> is imaginary and <i>B</i>
    real, we get non-logical actions, <i>B,</i> justified by the pretext, <i>A.</i>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0329">
    <strong>329.</strong>
    <i>c. The proposition is really a precept, but a real sanction enforced by
      an extraneous and real cause is appended to it.</i> That gives a logical action:
    the thing is done to escape the sanction.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0330">
    <strong>330.</strong>
    <i>d. The proposition is a precept, but the sanction is imaginary, or
      enforcible only by an imaginary power.</i> We get a non-logical action justified
    by the sanction.<sup><a href="#footnote-0330-01" id="ref-0330-01">1</a></sup>

  <p id="section-0331">
    <strong>331.</strong>
    The terms of ordinary speech rarely have sharply defined meanings. The
    term "sanction" may be used more or less loosely. Here we have taken it in
    the strict sense. Broadly speaking, one might say that a sanction is always
    present. In the case of a scientific proposition the sanction might be the
    pleasure of reasoning soundly or the pain of reasoning amiss. But to go into
    such niceties would be just a waste of time.

    Device B-I<i>β</i>: <i>Introduction of a divinity or of personified
      abstractions.</i> A very simple elaboration of the taboo, or pure precept, is
    involved in the introduction of a personal god, or of personifications such
    as Nature, by will of which non-logical actions are required
    of human beings and are therefore logicalized. How the requirement
    arises is often left dark. "A god (or Nature) wills that so and so be done."
    "And if it is not done?" The question remains unanswered. But very often
    there is an answer; it is asserted that the god (or Nature) will punish
    violators of the precept. In such a case we get a sanctioned precept of the
    species <i>d</i> above.

    When the Greeks said that "strangers and beggars come from

    they were merely voicing their inclination to be hospitable to visitors, and
    Zeus was dragged in to give a logical colouring to the custom, by implying
    that the hospitality was offered either in reverence for Zeus, or to avoid
    the punishment that Zeus held in store for violators of the precept.

    case where such embellishments are not supplemented by multiple legends and
    logical elaborations; and through these new adjuncts we get mythologies and
    theologies that carry us farther and farther away from the concept of
    non-logical conduct. It may be worth while to caution that theologies at all
    complicated belong to restricted classes of people only. With them we depart
    from the field of popular interpretations and enter an intellectual or
    scholarly domain. To the variety in question here belong the interpretations
    of the Fathers of the Christian Church, such as the doctrine that the pagan
    gods were devils.

    <strong>335.</strong>
    Device B-I<i>δ</i>: <i>Metaphysical entities taken as real.</i> Here reality is
    ascribed not to a personal god or to a personification, but to a
    metaphysical abstraction. "The true," "the beautiful," "the good," "the
    honest," "virtue," "morality," "natural law," "humanity," "solidarity,"
    "progress," or their opposite abstractions, enjoin or forbid certain
    actions, and the actions become logical consequences of the
    abstractions.<sup><a href="#footnote-0335-01" id="ref-0335-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0336">
    <strong>336.</strong>
    In interpretations of the B-I<i>β</i> variety, the personal god can inflict a
    punishment because he chooses to. In the case of "Nature" the punishment is
    an automatic consequence of the conduct. Those
    interpretations, therefore, are respectably logical. In the case of
    metaphysical abstractions, however, the logic is flimsy indeed. You tell a
    person, "You must do that because it is good," and he replies, "But I do not
    choose to do what is good." You are checkmated, for milord Good, estimable
    worthy that he may be, does not wield the thunderbolts that Zeus wields. So
    our latter-day Christians keep the God of the Old Testament but strip Him of
    all His weapons. There could be no trifling with the God of the Hebrews, who
    fiercely avenged transgressions of His laws, or with the God of St. Paul,
    who was no whit less quick to wrath. But, armed with the abstractions of
    their pseudo-science, with what can the neo-Christians threaten the
    unbeliever? Or what can they do for the believer to make his belief worth
    while? The answer is, "Nothing." The conduct they recommend is simply
    non-logical conduct. That does not mean that it may not be as beneficial to
    individual or society as any other, or even more so. It may or may not be.
    But in any event it is certain that it is not the logical inference from a
    principle, like the inference from the existence of a divine power and will
    that unbelievers will be punished and believers
    rewarded.<sup><a href="#footnote-0336-01" id="ref-0336-01">1</a></sup>

    <strong>337.</strong>
    Device B-I<i>ε</i>: <i>What is real is the accord between the principles and
      certain sentiments.</i> This manner of envisaging facts is implicit rather than
    explicit. So for certain neo-Christians the reality of Jesus seems to come
    down to an accord between their conception of Him and certain sentiments
    they hold. They abandon the objective field, deny the divine nature of
    Christ, and seem not to care very much about His historical reality. They
    are satisfied with asserting that Christ is the most perfect type of
    humanity, which means that their notions of Christ happen to coincide with
    what, according to their sentiments, is the most perfect type of human
    being. Once on that road they finish by throwing all theology, all rites,
    overboard and end with the assertion that "religion is a manner of
    living."<sup><a href="#footnote-0337-01" id="ref-0337-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0338">
    <strong>338.</strong>
    Along that line they might seem to be approximating the concept of
    non-logical conduct; but they are still radically at variance with it, since
    they are thinking not of what is, but of what ought to be, and rob the
    "ought" of the subordinate character
    (§ <a href="#section-0326">326</a>)
    it might well have in the case of some few individuals, and give it
    an absolute status that altogether transcends the experimental field. Their
    theories, in a word, have no other purpose than to decorate non-logical
    impulse with a logical rouge.

    B-II: <i>The reality is no longer direct;</i> that is to say, it is no longer
    held that there is a god, a personification, an abstraction, or the like,
    from which non-logical actions may be logically inferred.
    <i>It is assumed that such actions have arisen spontaneously, by reasonings good
      or bad based on facts well or badly authenticated.</i> The difference between
    this variety and the B-I group is a radical one; for whereas the B-I devices
    ascribed reality to entities foreign to the experimental field, the entities
    posited in this variety arise within the experimental field, and the only
    questions are whether they have actually been observed and whether the
    assumed consequences are real consequences. "Beggars come from Zeus" is an
    interpretation of the B-I variety. I create the entity Zeus, which I assume
    to be real, and from its existence I draw certain inferences. "Whoever is
    hospitable to beggars will be happy" is an interpretation of the B-II
    variety. I pretend that I have observed that people who have been hospitable
    to beggars have been happy, and I draw the inference that if they continue
    to be hospitable to beggars they will continue to be happy. I have not
    created any entity; I am using real facts, combining them as I see fit.

    Device B-II<i>α</i>: <i>Observation imperfect, inferences logical.</i> This method of
    reasoning aims to throw back upon the premises a logico-experimental
    insufficiency that cannot be disputed. We have certain assertions that are
    manifestly in contradiction with logico-experimental knowledge. We may
    assume that the contradiction arises because the reasoning which produces
    the conclusions is not logical, and we are thereby carried into the domain
    of non-logical conduct. Or else we may hold that the reasoning is logical,
    but that it starts with premises inconsistent with experimental knowledge
    and so leads to conclusions where the contradiction is likewise apparent. In
    that way we are able to remain within the field of logical conduct. Typical
    of this variety are the theories of Herbert Spencer (§§ <a href="#section-0285">285</a>,
    <a href="#section-0289">289</a>-95).
    The rôle ascribed to non-logical conduct is reduced to a minimum
    and may even be eliminated. Underlying certain phenomena are certain
    observations of fact. It is assumed that from such alleged observations
    human beings have drawn inferences, reasoning very much as any thinker would
    reason. So we get the doctrines of those human beings and the reasons for
    their conduct.

    Concepts of this kind figure to a greater or lesser extent in almost
    all theories dealing with the "origins" of social phenomena such as

    actual origin <i>A</i> (Figure 9).
    If the development took place along a continuous
    line <i>ABCDP,</i> it would be possible, in a sense, to take one of the
    intermediate phenomena <i>B, C</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as the origin, or cause, of <i>P.</i>
    If, for
    instance, going as far back as our historical knowledge permits, we found a
    thing <i>B</i> of the same nature as <i>P,</i> though much simpler, we should not go too
    far wrong in regarding it as the origin, or cause, of <i>P.</i>

    Unfortunately the assumption of development along a continuous line
    does not at all conform with the facts as regards social phenomena, or even
    as regards not a few biological phenomena. The development,
    rather, seems to take place along a line with many branches
    (Figure 10), even still ignoring the complex character of social phenomena,
    which hardly permits us to dissociate the social phenomenon <i>P</i> from other
    social phenomena (§ <a href="04.html#section-0513">513</a>).
    Facts <i>B, C, D</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (Figure 10) are no longer
    located along a straight continuous
    line, but stand at the extremities or intersections of branch lines; and we
    cannot, even as a hypothesis very remotely approximative to the facts,
    assume that <i>C,</i> for example, or <i>E,</i> or any other similar fact observable in
    the past, is the origin, the cause, of <i>P,</i> observable in the present.

    To take a concrete example: Reinach sees in taboos the origin of
    religion. In so doing, he seems to take the position pictured in Figure 9. <i>B</i>
    standing for the taboos, <i>P</i> for present-day religions. But even assuming that
    religion is unconnected with other social phenomena,
    the situation is actually as represented in Figure 10, and the
    taboos <i>B</i> would be the extremity of a by-path. Taboos cannot be taken as the
    origin of religion. They may be regarded as simple types of phenomena, of
    which the religions <i>C, Q, P</i> are complex types. That is all the truth there
    is in the theories of Reinach, a fairly important truth, for that matter,
    since it emphasizes the part played by non-logical actions in religious
    phenomena.

    The intermediate

    domain of experimental reality. Yet, historically speaking, they have not
    been altogether wasted: for they have served to open a breach in the ethical
    and <i>a priori</i> theories that have been explaining <i>P</i> by imaginary principles.

    Device B-II<i>β</i>: <i>Myths have a historical basis or else are imitations of
      other myths.</i> Origins and evolution being discarded, it is assumed that every
    myth is the deformed reflection of something real. Of this variety were the
    euhemeristic theories, so called, as to the origin of the pagan gods (§§
    <a href="05.html#section-0682">682</a>-708).
    Nothing is more certain than that there have been cases where
    human beings have been deified. The euhemeristic error lies, first of all,
    in generalizing a particular fact, and then in confusing the point <i>B</i> in
    Figure 9 with the point <i>B</i> in Figure 10, in assuming, that is, that because
    one fact precedes another fact in time, it is the origin of it. The theories
    of Palaephatus (§ <a href="05.html#section-0661">661</a>) also belong to this variety.

    In general, interpretations of this kind are very easy to work out. One
    arbitrarily changes in a myth anything that needs to be changed to produce a
    picture that is real. Take, for example, Astolfo's hippogriff in the <i>Orlando
      furioso</i> of Ariosto. The wingèd horse can be made a real horse by
    interpreting the story in the sense that the hippogrirt was some very swift
    horse that was therefore spoken of as having wings. Dante sees Francesca and
    her brother-in-law lashed by "the hellish hurricane." The hurricane can be
    interpreted as a symbol of the carnal passion that smites the two lovers
    like a hurricane. In such a procedure not the slightest difficulty will ever
    be encountered (§ <a href="05.html#section-0661">661</a>).

    With this variety we may class theories that explain the non-logical
    actions observable in a given society as imitations of non-logical actions
    prevalent in other societies. To tell the truth, not all non-logical actions
    are eliminated by this device; they are merely reduced in number, several of
    them being taken as duplicates of
    one.<sup><a href="#footnote-0349-01" id="ref-0349-01">1</a></sup>

    Device B-II<i>γ</i>: <i>Myths taken as historical fact plus a fictional
      appendage.</i> In this variety we come a little closer to reality. In every myth
    the legend is assumed to have a nucleus of historical fact covered over by
    an alluvium of fiction. One removes the accretion, and finds the nucleus of
    fact underneath. Many books have been written from that point of view. Not
    so long since all the legends that have come down from Graeco-Roman
    antiquity were treated in that

    Device B-III: <i>The principles underlying non-logical actions are
      allegories.</i> The actions, it is held, are in reality logical. They seem to be
    non-logical only because the allegories are taken literally. A further
    assumption locates the source of such errors in language by an allegorical
    interpretation. Max Müller
    writes:<sup><a href="#footnote-0351-01" id="ref-0351-01">1</a></sup>
    "There are many myths in Hesiod, of
    late origin, where we have only to replace a full verb by an auxiliary, in
    order to change mythical into logical language. Hesiod [<i>Theogonia,</i> vv.
    211-12 (White, pp. 94-95)], calls Nyx (Night) the mother of Moros (Fate),
    and the dark Kêr (Destruction), of Thanatos (Death), Hypnos (Sleep) and the
    tribe of the Oneiroi (Dreams).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now let us use our modern expressions,
    such as: 'the stars are seen as night approaches,' 'we sleep,' 'we dream,'
    'we die,' 'we run danger during the night'&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we
    have translated the language of Hesiod&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. into modern forms of thought
    and speech."
  </p>

  <p id="section-0352">
    <strong>352.</strong>
    On that basis all myths would be charades. It seems incredible that a
    theory so manifestly absurd could have gained such wide acceptance. Müller's
    disciples did even worse than their master, and the solar myth became a
    convenient and universal explanation for every conceivable legend.

    Class C. In this class, really, non-logical actions are not interpreted
    in such a way as to make them logical. They are eliminated, so that only
    logical actions are left. That serves just as well to reduce all conduct to
    logic. Such opinions are widely current in our time, and are an article of
    faith with a great many people who worship a powerful divinity known to them
    as "Science." Not a few humanitarians are of the same tribe.

    Other people reason more soundly; and after noting a thing that is true
    enough&mdash;that science has contributed greatly to the advance of
    civilization&mdash;they go farther still and try to show that nothing that
    is not science can be useful. As the type of such theories one might quote
    the celebrated argument of
    Buckle:<sup><a href="#footnote-0354-01" id="ref-0354-01">1</a></sup>
    "It is evident, that if we look at
    mankind in the aggregate, their moral and intellectual conduct is regulated
    by the moral and intellectual notions prevalent in their own time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    Now, it requires but a superficial acquaintance with history to be aware
    that this standard is constantly changing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This extreme mutability in
    the ordinary standard of human actions shows that the conditions on which
    the standard depends must themselves be very mutable; and these conditions,
    whatever they may be, are evidently the originators of the moral and
    intellectual conduct of the great average of mankind.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Here, then, we have a basis on which we can safely proceed. We know that
    the main cause of human actions is extremely variable; we have only,
    therefore, to apply this test to any set of circumstances which are supposed
    to be the cause, and if we find that such circumstances are not very
    variable, we must infer that they are not the cause we are attempting to
    discover.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Applying this test to moral motives, or to the dictates of what is called
    moral instinct, we shall at once see how extremely small is the influence
    those motives have exercised over the progress of civilization. For there
    is, unquestionably, nothing to be found in the world which has undergone so
    little change as those great dogmas of which moral systems are
    composed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
  </p>
  <p>
    "But, if we contrast this stationary aspect of moral truths with the
    progressive aspect of intellectual truths, the difference is indeed
    startling.<sup><a href="#footnote-0354-02" id="ref-0354-02">2</a></sup>
    All the great moral systems which have exercised much influence
    have been fundamentally the same; all the great intellectual systems have
    been fundamentally different.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since civilization is the product of
    moral and intellectual agencies, and since that product is constantly
    changing, it evidently cannot be regulated by the stationary agent; because
    when surrounding circumstances are unchanged, a stationary agent can only
    produce a stationary effect. The only other agent is the intellectual one;
    and that this is the real mover may be proved."
  </p>

  <p id="section-0355">
    <strong>355.</strong>
    Buckle's reasoning is sound provided one add that all human conduct is
    logical and derives from moral and intellectual principles. But that
    proposition is false. In the first place, many very important actions are
    non-logical. Secondly, the things designated by the terms "moral principle"
    and "intellectual principle" are wanting in exactness: they cannot be taken
    as premises in a rigorous argument. Thirdly, Buckle's reasoning has the
    general defect of arguments by elimination in sociological matters&mdash;the
    enumeration is never
    complete.<sup><a href="#footnote-0355-01" id="ref-0355-01">1</a></sup>
    He omits things of great importance.
    Theoretical principles of morality may be the same, and moral practices very
    different&mdash;for instance, the peoples who all preach the Christian
    ethics by no means all behave in the same way in
    practice.<sup><a href="#footnote-0355-02" id="ref-0355-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0356">
    <strong>356.</strong>
    Buckle's argument reduces the practical rôle of moral theories
    to very small proportions, and in that it accords with the facts. But
    what it takes away from morals ought not be handed over to an "intellectual
    principle" (whatever that may be), but to the patrimony of non-logical
    actions, economic progress, improvements in communications, and the like. It
    may well be that something has to be assigned to scientific progress all the
    same, and therefore to the said "intellectual principle"; but there is a big
    difference between such indirect, non-logical influence, and a direct action
    by way of logical inference from a given
    principle.<sup><a href="#footnote-0356-01" id="ref-0356-01">1</a></sup>

    We need carry our study of this special classification no farther. It
    has already shown that existing doctrines may be broken up into two
    different elements: certain sentiments, and inferences from those
    sentiments. It opens, in other words, a path that it may or may not be
    profitable to follow to the end. We shall see as we go on.

    Many statesmen, many historians, recognize non-logical actions without
    giving them that name and without going to the trouble of finding their
    theory. Just a few examples taken here and there from the works of
    Bayle,<sup><a href="#footnote-0358-01" id="ref-0358-01">1</a></sup>
    implicit in which are several theories of non-logical conduct&mdash;and it
    is indeed surprising to find in a writer who lived two centuries and more
    ago certain truths that are unappreciated even today. Bayle declares and
    repeats that "opinions are not the rule of conduct"; and that "man does not
    regulate his conduct by his opinions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    The Turks hold certain tenets of
    that doctrine of the Stoics [fatalism], and they carry the business of
    predestination to extreme lengths. Nevertheless they may be seen
    to flee danger as other men do, and they are far from charging in battle
    with the courage of the French, who do not believe in predestination." The
    existence and importance of non-logical conduct could not be recognized in
    plainer terms. Find a general form for this observation of particular fact,
    and we get the starting-point for a theory of non-logical conduct.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0359">
    <strong>359.</strong>
    Bayle further observes, <i>Ibid.,</i> § 139: "It cannot be said that people
    who fail to live according to the precepts of their religion do not believe
    in a God"; and he presses the point, <i>Ibid.,</i> § 136: "Man does not act
    according to his principles. He may be as rational a creature as you like,
    but it is none the less true that he almost never acts according to his
    principles. [In other words his conduct is non-logical.] He has indeed the
    strength, in speculative matters, not to draw wrong conclusions; for in such
    reflections he sins rather in his readiness to accept false principles than
    in drawing mistaken conclusions from them. But it is quite another matter
    when good morals are in question. [A particular remark that is true in
    general.] In morals he almost never hits on false principles. Almost always
    the ideas of natural equity are present in his conscience. Nevertheless he
    is always deciding in favour of his uncontrolled desires. [The usual vague
    phraseology, but the substance accords with fact.]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    The true principle of human conduct&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    is naught but temperament, the natural inclination to
    pleasure, the taste for certain things, the desire to please, the habits
    acquired in intercourse with friends, or some other disposition arising from
    the depths of human nature, whatever the country in which one is born [This
    contradicts the preceding and is to be deleted.] and whatever the knowledge
    that has been instilled in the mind."
  </p>
  <p>
    That comes very close to the facts. If we tried to give greater precision to
    Bayle's language, and establish a stricter classification, would we not have
    a theory of non-logical actions&mdash;their great importance so becoming
    more and more apparent?

    Bayle quotes with approval a passage from Nicolle: "&nbsp;'When the time
    comes for human beings to pass from speculation to action, they do not
    follow consequences; and strange it is to see how the
    human mind can stop at certain speculative truths without going on to their
    logical consequences in practice, which seem so bound up with those truths
    as to be in no way separable from
    them.'&nbsp;"<sup><a href="#footnote-0360-01" id="ref-0360-01">1</a></sup>

    Bayle soundly enough observes, <i>Ibid.,</i> § 51, that "the pagan religion
    was satisfied with an external rite" (§ <a href="02.html#section-0174">174</a>);
    but he went wrong in
    believing, <i>Ibid.,</i> § 122, that it "had no influence on morals." He failed to
    perceive that ritual practices intensified sentiments (non-logical actions)
    and that such sentiments were in turn sources of morality.

    He goes to some pains to prove that atheism is preferable to idolatry.
    To understand him aright we have to take account of the times in which he
    was living and the perils to which he was exposed. Just as in our time there
    are persons who give perpetual chase to "immoral" books, so in Bayle's time
    there were those who kept open season on books against Christianity. Unable
    to whip the horse, Bayle whips the saddle, and belabours idolatry with
    criticisms that apply just as well to all religions. At bottom his argument
    tends to show that since the majority of human actions are non-logical,
    forms of belief are of no great importance.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0363">
    <strong>363.</strong>
    Montesquieu did not get that point, and his reply to what he calls
    "Bayle's paradox" is of little or no value. He is solving the problem by
    restating it when he says: "A prince who loves religion and fears it is a
    lion surrendering to the hand that caresses it, or to the voice that quiets
    it; the prince who fears religion and hates it is like the wild beast biting
    at the chains that keep it from attacking passers-by; the prince who has no
    religion at all is the terrible beast that never feels his freedom till he
    is rending and
    devouring."<sup><a href="#footnote-0363-01" id="ref-0363-01">1</a></sup>
    Underlying all this declamation, which is mere
    fustian, is the proposition, evidently, that human beings act logically in
    accord with their beliefs. But that is the very thing Bayle denies; and
    proofs, not
    mere asseverations of the opposite, were required to refute him (§
    <a href="04.html#section-0368">368</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0364">
    <strong>364.</strong>
    Taking his stand on logical conduct, Montesquieu says that "even if it
    were useless for subjects to have religions it would not be useless for
    princes to have them." Starting with the premise of non-logical conduct, we
    are carried to a conclusion directly opposite:
    the person in command needs rational combinations particularly, and the
    person who obeys needs more particularly an unreasoned rule independent of
    his scant knowledge.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0365">
    <strong>365.</strong>
    The weakness in Bayle's argument is not the one that Montesquieu
    criticizes. It lies in an altogether different direction. After noting and
    amply demonstrating that human beings do not act according to logical
    inferences from principles, from opinions, and that a great many human
    actions of great importance are non-logical, Bayle should have centred his
    attention upon such actions. Then he would have seen that they were of many
    kinds; and he would have had to decide whether they were independent or
    influenced one another mutually. He would readily have seen that they do
    exert reciprocal influences, and therefore that the social importance of
    religion lies not at all in the logical value of its dogmas, its principles,
    its theology, but rather in the non-logical actions that it promotes. He was
    actually on the road to that conclusion when he asserted that "a religion
    has to be judged by the cult which it practises"; and when he stated that
    the pagan religion stopped at a purely external ritualism, he could hardly
    have been closer to experimental truth. One step more and he would have had
    the truth entire. But unfortunately he turns aside. Instead of judging
    religions, which are non-logical actions, by their social influence, he
    loses his way in questions as to their moral value, or better, as to their
    relation to what he is pleased to call "morality"; and in that we have a
    counter-attack by logic, which is again invading territory from which it had
    been expelled.
  </p>
  <p>
    From that point of view one might repeat of Bayle what Sumner Maine says of
    him in commenting on the writings of
    Rousseau:<sup><a href="#footnote-0365-01" id="ref-0365-01">1</a></sup>
    "It [Rousseau's] was the first attempt to re-erect the edifice of human
    belief after the purely iconoclastic efforts commenced by Bayle, and in part
    by our own Locke, and consummated by Voltaire." But that goes to show how,
    in view of the indefiniteness of ordinary language, utterly different
    concepts may be expressed in the same words. Maine is thinking not of
    science or theory but of practice, as is clearly apparent from what
    immediately follows: "and [Rousseau's system has], besides, the superiority
    which every constructive effort will always enjoy over one that is merely
    destructive." It is not the function of theory to create beliefs, but to
    explain existing ones and discover their uniformities. Bayle took a great
    step forward in that direction in exposing the vacuity of certain
    interpretations and opening the way for the discovery of others more
    consistent with the facts. From the standpoint of theory, his work, far from
    being inferior to Rousseau's, is as superior to Rousseau's as the astronomy
    of Kepler is superior to the astronomy of Cosmas Indicopleustes. He may be
    blamed only for stopping too soon on a road which he had so splendidly
    opened.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0366">
    <strong>366.</strong>
    Why he did so is hard to guess. The case is not rare. It would seem as
    though in science it is often necessary to destroy before building can
    begin. It may also be that Bayle was deterred from a complete expression of
    his ideas by the moral and religious persecutions common in his time, that
    the atmosphere of persecution affected the thinker not only materially but
    intellectually also, and constrained him to disguise his thought under
    certain forms. Just so in our own time persecutions and annoyances of all
    sorts emanating from votaries of the religion of sexual virtue have created
    an atmosphere of hypocrisy in speech and thought that influences writing.
    And so, if in some future age the expression of human thought comes to be
    liberated from sex "ties" just as it has already been freed of the ties
    requiring deference to the Bible, people desiring to understand the thought
    of writers of our day will have to take account of the masks with which it
    is disguised in deference to contemporary prejudices. Another cause may have
    been the scientific inadequacies of ordinary language. If Bayle had not had
    at his disposal such terms
    as "religion" and "morality," which seem to be exact but are not, he would
    have been compelled to deal with things instead of with words, sentiments,
    fictions; and in that case perhaps he might not have lost his way
    (§ <a href="01.html#section-0114">114</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0367">
    <strong>367.</strong>
    But his case is merely typical of a vastly populous class of cases
    where error in argument is directly proportionate to defects in language.
    Anyone, therefore, desirous of remaining in the logico-experimental field and
    concerned not to be led astray into the domain of sentiment, must ever be on
    his watch against this the greatest enemy of science
    (§ <a href="01.html#section-0119">119</a>). In social
    matters, human beings as a rule use language that lures them away from the
    logico-experimental domain. What does such language really mean? We have to
    be clear on that question before we can go farther, and to it we shall
    devote the chapter next following.

        Similar contradictions are observable in metaphysical and theological
        disputes as to "free will," "predestination," "efficacious grace" (§ <a href="#section-0280">280</a>),
        and the like. Pascal well ridicules some of these incoherences; but,
        speaking as a metaphysicist and theologian himself, he replaces them with
        arguments that are worth but little more, and sometimes less. He had begun
        by saying, <i>Lettres à une provinciale,</i> I, p. 6: "I never quarrel over names,
        provided I am told what meanings they are given"; and with that he was
        almost taking his stand within the domain of logico-experimental science (§
        <a href="01.html#section-0119">119</a>). But he soon relapses, to go back to the domain of metaphysics,
        theology, sentiment.

        trying to persuade his fellow-citizens that a colony established at Capua
        might become dangerous to Rome. For that reason he may not have been

        are trying to ascertain not Cicero's personal views, but the opinions
        current in his time. And if he used the argument he used, it means that he thought it reflected the feeling of a

        One may also detect a certain conception of non-logical conduct in the
        fact that Aristotle ascribes the virtues&mdash;temperance, justice, courage,
        and so on&mdash;to the non-rational part of the human being, <i>Magna moralia,</i>
        I, 5, 1 (Stock, p. 1185-b): "Foresight, intelligence (quickness of wit),
        wisdom, learning (aptitude for learning), memory, and other similar things
        arise in the rational part [of the soul]. In the non-rational one finds what
        are called the virtues: temperance, justice, energy, and all other moral
        qualities that are deemed worthy of praise." Aristotle's doctrine of the
        logical or non-logical character of conduct in general was perhaps not very
        clear&mdash;such doctrines rarely are. All the same he seems to have
        recognized non-logical elements, supplementing them with logical elements,
        and subordinating them to the logical. In the <i>Politica,</i> VII, 12, 6 (Rackham,
        p. 601), he says that three things make a man good and virtuous:
        <i>φύσις, ἔθος, λόγος</i>:
        "nature, habit, reason." As for the non-logical element,
        Aristotle admits that human beings act, in part at least, under the
        influence of external circumstances, such as climate, soil, and so on. In
        <i>Ibid.,</i> VII, 6 (Rackham, pp. 565-66), he clearly relates the conduct of human
        beings to such circumstances; and in <i>De partibus animalium,</i> II, 4 [An
        erroneous reference: read: <i>Historia animalium,</i> VIII, 28-29 (Thompson, pp.
        606-07).&mdash;A.&nbsp;L.], he explains just how he thinks the relationship
        functions, in general, for living beings. The author (Aristotle ?) of the
        <i>Problemata,</i> offers, XIV (Forster, pp. 909-10), additional reflections on
        such relationships. So far we are within the domain of the non-logical. But
        the writer at once takes steps to be rid of it by a procedure that is
        general and which lies in subordinating it to logic: it becomes the material
        with which reason works. <i>Magna moralia,</i> I, 11, 3 (Stock, p. 1187-b):
        "Judgment, will, and all that is in accord with reason, constitute the
        principle of conduct, good or bad." Aristotle is not aware that in that he
        is contradicting what he said, in the <i>Politica,</i> that people who live in cold
        countries are courageous. In this case, the "principle" of courageous
        action, that is to say, the "judgment and will" to expose oneself to peril,
        is determined, according to Aristotle, by climate and not by "reason." He
        thinks he clears his traces by saying, <i>Magna moralia,</i> I, 11, 5 (Stock, <i>loc.
          cit.</i>), that first requisite is help from nature, and next will; but ignoring
        any metaphysical question as to the freedom of the will, which we choose not
        to go into, we still have the problem, first of knowing whether the two
        things that he considers independent are so in reality, and then in what
        proportions they figure in any concrete act. Going into that problem, one
        finds that there is conduct in which the first element, the non-logical,
        prevails, and other conduct in which the second element, the logical,
        prevails.
      </p>

        Aristotle was lured from the scientific path, aside from metaphysical
        considerations, by that great enemy of all social science: the mania for achieving
        some practical result. In the <i>Ethica Nicomachea,</i> II, 2, 1 (Rackham, p. 75),
        he says that he does not desire to confine himself to theory only: "For we
        study not to know what virtue is, but to become good; otherwise our study
        would be of no use." Aristotle had no other means of influencing others than
        logical argument; and so he was, as he had to be, inclined to make logic the
        controlling force in human conduct.

        Ritter, <i>Geschichte der Philosophie alter Zeit,</i> Vol. III, p. 305
        (Morrison, Vol. III, pp. 262-63): "More interested in didacticism than in
        physic, Socrates sought the principle of all morality strictly in dialectic.
        So virtue, in his opinion, had no other foundaton than reason and knowledge.
        But Plato already had found that courage and moderation, two necessary
        phases of virtue, must pre-exist in the temperament of the human being,
        whose impulses lie in the heart, not in the head. Aristotle went even
        farther in that direcdon and clung more tightly still to physic, for which
        he had a temperamental predilection. As the first principle of virtue he
        takes not reason but natural impulse and the emotional states of the soul
        (<i>πάθη</i>)." Zeller, <i>Philosophie der Griechen,</i> Vol. III, p. 118 (missing in
        Alleyne): [For Socrates] "knowledge is not just an indispensable
        prerequisite, not just an auxiliary, to true morality: it directly
        constitutes all morality; and when knowledge is lacking, he is not content
        with the mere recognition of an imperfect virtue: he cannot see any virtue
        at all. Not till later on, in Plato, and more completely in Aristotle, will
        we find a correction of that narrow form of the Socratic doctrine of
        virtue."

        Comte is to an extent aware of the evolution he has undergone,
        <i>Système,</i> Vol. III, Preface, p. vii: "Comparing this volume with the
        historical portions of my fundamental treatise, it will be noted that my
        general system is deeper and more complete, whereas my special demonstrations are less developed. From the
        latter point of view, this final elaboration of my philosophy of history is
        at variance with my original announcements, which promised more details and
        proofs in this volume than in my first outlines, to which, instead, I am now
        obliged to refer for such things. Brought to a clearer understanding of the
        true character of the philosophical régime, I have come to feel that
        systematic assertions, which I first regarded as something merely provisory,
        should be the normal rule of any truly systematic exposition. The progress I
        have made and the prestige it has won for me allow me in my advancing years
        to fall in with the free and rapid stride of my chief predecessors,
        Aristotle, Descartes, and Leibnitz, who simply formulated their thoughts,
        leaving the task of verifying and developing them to their readers. That
        division of labour in intercourse between minds is at once the most
        honourable for the initiated and the most profitable for founders." And in
        this last, Comte is unquestionably right! It is no little convenience if one
        can manage to be believed without being pestered for proofs!

        <i>Système,</i> Vol. IV, pp. 377-78: "To modify public life, it is enough
        for [the Priesthood of Humanity] that circumstances shall have brought to
        the fore some preponderant and responsible will. That condition has been
        fairly well provided for in France since the advent of the Dictatorship,
        which frees organized doctrine from the irksome obligation of deferring to
        legislatures that are ever disposed to perpetuate a revolutionary condition,
        even when they are reactionary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Without having to convert either the
        public or its leaders, Positivism, therefore, in virtue of its fundamental
        truth and its utter seasonableness, can win a partial ascendancy adequate
        for realizing the final transition, even unbeknown to the principal
        supporters of the movement." An action that takes place unbeknown to the
        individual who performs it obviously belongs to the genus of non-logical
        actions.

        Mill, innocent soul, goes on to say, <i>loc. cit.:</i> "To justify that [such

        calculated to produce evil to someone else." He did not realize that
        sophistries are never wanting to show that the damage is there. Notice what
        happens in countries where people set out to enforce temperance and virtue
        in the holy name of "Progress": <i>Giornale d'ltalia,</i> March 19, 1912: "Atlanta,
        Georgia, March 2. Last evening <i>Commendatore</i> Alessandro Bonci, who was
        stopping here temporarily in connexion with professional engagements, was
        arrested at the Georgian Terrace Hotel, together with his wife, his
        secretary, and his pianist, for violating the liquor law. It seems that
        Signor Bonci and his friends, like good Italians, who serve wine two meals a
        day at least, had adopted an ingenious device for doing so in spite of the
        law that forbids the use of wines and liquors in the State of Georgia. For
        several days the manager of the hotel had noticed that towards the middle of
        their meals the Boncis and their friends were in the habit of setting on the
        table four little bottles such as are used by druggists, with labels giving
        directions for using the presumptive 'medicines.' The regularity with which
        the Bonci party drank the contents of the bottles twice a day, as though
        each member of it were suffering from the same disease and required the same
        treatment, at length aroused the suspicions of the house detective. He
        mentioned the matter to a zealous policeman, who last evening, when the time
        for the 'treatment' came, confiscated the bottles. Each of them was found to
        have the capacity of a wine-glass and to contain nothing but excellent
        Chianti, with which, it seems, <i>Commendatore</i> Bonci travels well supplied in
        order to cope with the surprises of American law. Despite the lively
        protestations of Signor Bonci, the four offenders were put into an
        automobile and taken to the Court House, where Judge Ralendorf, after a
        summary inquiry, continued the case till this morning, fixing bail at
        $2,000. Then came the best, not to say the worst, of it. The celebrated
        tenor found he had no more than $150 in
        his pocket, and he was faced with
        the prospect of spending the night in jail."
      </p>
      <p>
        We may guess that if Signor Bonci had remembered that the ointment of St.
        John Goldmouth may be used on the hands of American reformers with as good
        effect as it had in Boccaccio's time on the hands of our virtuous Italian
        Inquisitors, he might have escaped such annoyance. In general terms: You
        happen to be in the dining-car when the train enters one of the abstemious
        states of the American Union, and the glass of wine that you were about to
        drink is snatched from the table in front of you. If you ask, "What harm am
        I doing to my neighbour by drinking this glass of wine?", the answer comes
        quick and prompt: "You are setting a bad example!" And the rabble that
        enforces its will upon you in that fashion speaks with indignation of
        Spanish Catholics who, to prevent setting bad examples, refuse to tolerate
        in Spain any public worship except the Roman Catholic!

        to be sought in sacred opinions and illusions. Ignorance of natural causes
        first created gods for humanity: imposture clothed them with terror. The
        deadly thought of them pursued the human being without making him better,
        filled him with fears to no purpose, packed his mind with nightmares,

        humanity's burden of woe has no whit been lightened, but has been made
        heavier rather by his religions, his governments, his education, his

        adopt [By whom persuaded? By someone

        the ills that afflict the human race. Not with Nature lies the
        responsibility for human unhappiness. No angry God ever willed that humanity
        should live in tears. No hereditary depravity made mortals wicked and
        miserable. Those deplorable consequences are all and exclusively due to
        error."

        Farther along, in Chapter IX, we shall have to consider a still more
        general subject&mdash;the variability of the arguments to which human beings
        are prompted by sentiments, and which provide logical exteriors for
        non-logical conduct. A strictly inductive course, such as we have been
        following, brings up the particular problem in advance of the general. That
        has the drawback of compelling us to examine the particular problem first,
        and to keep going back to things on which we have already touched. It has,
        on the other hand, the great advantage of making the materials we work with

        [One need hardly remind the reader that these synoptic pictures of
        Pareto's classifications are unintelligible apart from the exposition
        <i>seriatim</i> of the various categories that he proceeds to make. They have to be
        continually re-read in connexion with the text that follows. This table is
        particularly obscure in itself, not only because of exceptionally opaque
        writing but because implicit in it is another classification that Pareto for
        some reason does not see fit to utilize. It is clear that the devices in
        Class A are used from a sceptical standpoint to discredit beliefs on logical
        grounds. The B-I and B-III devices are used by believers to represent their
        beliefs as logical. The other devices are "errors" commonly made by scholars
        in viewing the non-logical as logical. I use the term "device" for the sake
        of clarity; Pareto's term was "means." Whatever the term used, it has to be
        understood as not
        implying any intent to deceive on the part of a person using such a device
        or means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pareto's classifications, which are taken over from botany, envisage
        classes, genera and subgenera (sometimes species and subspecies). I keep
        these terms in the tables of classification. In the text at large, to avoid
        a fatiguing technical atmosphere, I often render "genus" and "species"
        loosely as "type," "kind," "sort," or more generally "variety": the "I<i>β</i>
        variety," or "1<i>β</i> type" would be, in the tables, the "1<i>β</i> subgenus," and so
        on. Pareto makes but little use of the "genus" in the structure proper of
        his theories, the one exception perhaps being his analysis of the residue of
        asceticism (§§ <a href="07.html#section-1163">1163</a> f.).
        The "class," on the other hand, is essential to his
        theory of interdependence and intensities (Chapter XII). Since residues
        increase or diminish in intensities by "classes," and interdependences arise
        primarily within "classes," it is clear that the structure of the "class"
        has all along to be borne in mind.&mdash;A.&nbsp;L.]

        The fact is mentioned by Xenophon's Socrates. <i>Memorabilia,</i> IV, 3, 16:
        "Since thou seest that when the god of Delphi is asked how best to please
        the gods, he replies: <i>By following the custom of the city.</i>" Cicero, <i>De
          legibus,</i> II, 16, 40: "Our law shall further provide that of all our
        ancestral rites the best should be fostered. When the Athenians consulted
        the Pythian Apollo as to which rites they had better practise, they received
        the oracle: 'Those customary with the forefathers.' Then they came back
        again, saying that the custom of the forefathers had often changed, and
        they asked which they should prefer of the various ancestral customs; and
        the god answered: 'The best.'&nbsp;" Cicero appends a logical consideration that
        has no logical force whatever: "And it is assuredly true that what is best
        should be taken as the most authentic tradition and the closest to God."

        <i>Remarques pour servir de Supplément à l'Essai sur les mœurs,</i> Pt. IV
        (<i>Œuvres,</i> Vol. V, p. 48): "Contemptible customs in a nation do not always
        indicate that that nation is itself contemptible." Among the blunders
        mentioned are the following: 1. Cicero's essay <i>De divinatione</i> was written
        after Caesar's death. But that is a small matter; if one is going to pretend
        that Caesar sent ambassadors to China, one may also pretend that he was
        living when Cicero wrote the essay. 2. The Chinese pantheon was much better
        filled than the Roman pantheon. That error on Voltaire's part may be
        forgiven, since it was the error of all the <i>philosophes</i> of his time. With a
        little care, however, he might have avoided the following: 3. Wittingly or
        unwittingly, he confuses Roman divination with the Etruscan. The god Tages
        belonged only to the latter. 4. Jupiter Optimus Maximus was by no means the
        only god in the official cult of Rome. [I cannot believe that Voltaire did
        not know that. The very glaringness of the error calls attention to a
        sacrilegious parody of French Chrisdanity in the allusions to Jupiter,
        Flora, and the Penates.&mdash;A.&nbsp;L.] 5. The Penates were not at all the gods
        of silly housewives. Servius, <i>In Vergilii Aeneidem,</i> II, v. 514 (Thilo-Hagen,
        Vol. I, p. 298): "The Penates are all the gods worshipped in the
        home." Rome herself had her Penates. Voltaire would use Cicero against the
        silly housewives, but Cicero himself invokes the Penates, <i>Pro Publio Sulla,</i>
        31, 86: "Wherefore, O ye gods of our forefathers, and ye, O Penates, who
        watch over this city and this country of ours, ye who during my consulship
        did confer your aid and your divine protection upon this state, upon the
        Roman People and its liberties, upon these homes, these temples, you do I
        invoke as witnesses to my integrity and honesty of purpose in appearing in
        defence of Publius Sulla." <i>Cf.</i> also <i>In Catilinam,</i> IV, 9, 18. 6. Whether he
        believed in such things or not, Caesar made a practice of consulting
        soothsayers. There is an allusion to that in <i>De divinatione,</i> I, 52, 119; II,
        16, 36, which Voltaire quotes; and <i>cf.</i> Dio Cassius, <i>Historia Romana,</i> XLIV,
        17, 18; Plutarch, <i>Caesar,</i> 63-64 (Perrin, Vol. VII, pp. 589-95); Suetonius,
        <i>Divus Julius,</i> 81; Pliny, <i>Historia naturalis,</i> XXVIII, 4 (2). To one of
        Cæsar's superstitions we have previously alluded in §
        <a href="02.html#footnote-0184-02">184<sup>2</sup></a>.
        7. Cicero does
        not dream of ridiculing all auspices. He was himself an augur, and speaks of
        auspices with the greatest respect, <i>De legibus,</i> II, 12, 31: "The office of
        augur stands very high and is of the greatest importance in the state [<i>i.e.,</i>
        in Cicero's ideal state] and it is clothed with the greatest prestige. And
        that I feel not because I am an augur but because we can think not
        otherwise." He had little or no regard for the intrinsic merits of augury;
        but he considered the institution useful to the state and consequently did
        not ridicule it (<i>cf.</i> the quotations in § <a href="#footnote-0313-01">313<sup>1</sup></a>).
        8. Cato was speaking not of
        the augurs, but of the haruspices: Cicero, <i>De divinatione,</i> II, 24, 51:
        "Familiar the old jest of Cato, who used to express his wonder that one
        haruspex could ever look at another without laughing." For that matter it
        is a common error to confuse Roman augury with Etruscan divination by
        inspection of entrails. Only when they could not help doing so did the
        Romans appeal to Etruscan divination. Tiberius Gracchus, the father of the
        Gracchi, on being accused by Etruscan soothsayers, who were functioning at
        an election, of calling for a vote against the auspices, addressed them as
        follows: Cicero, <i>De natura deorum,</i> II, 4, 11: "&nbsp;'You say that I am not in
        order, though I am putting this question as consul and as augur, and under
        good auspices? And you, Etruscans, you, barbarians&mdash;you presume to say
        what good auspices for the Roman People are? You presume to be interpreters
        for these <i>comitia?'</i> And he bade them to be gone from the Forum."

        <i>Historiae,</i> VI, 56, 8-12 (Paton, Vol. III, p. 395). After noting the
        great rôle of religion in Roman public life, Polybius adds: "That will seem
        strange to many. As for me, I believe that religion was established with an
        eye to the masses. In fact, if the city were made up entirely of educated
        people, such an institution might never have been called for. But since the
        masses everywhere are fickle and untrustworthy, full of lawless passions,
        unreasoning angers, violent impulses, they can be controlled only by
        mysterious terrors and tragic fears. It seems to me, therefore, that not by
        chance and not without strong motive did the ancients introduce these
        beliefs in gods and hells to the multitude." Strabo, <i>Geographica,</i> I, 2, 8
        (Jones, Vol. I, p. 71): "Since neither women in the mass nor the utterly
        untutored mob can be influenced by philosophical discourse and preached into
        piety, reverence, and faith, superstition has to be called in." And then:
        ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;myths being like that and turning out to the advantage of society,
        civilized living, and the continuity of the human race." <i>Cf.</i> Plutarch,
        <i>Adversus Colotem,</i> 31 (Goodwin, Vol. V, pp. 379-80). Then Livy, <i>Ab urbe
          condita,</i> I, 19, 4: "He [Numa] thought that fear of the gods should be
        instilled the very first thing, as a most effective measure for a populace
        that in those days was still crude and ingenuous (<i>imperitam</i>)." Here we are
        wholly within the realm of logical conduct, the masses being lured into
        religion by subterfuge. Cicero, <i>De legibus,</i> II, 13, 32 (Atticus, alluding to
        the different views of the two augurs Marcellus and Appius): "&nbsp;'I have
        examined their writings and I find that according to the one, the auspices
        you mention were devised for purposes of state; while according to the other
        it would seem that you can actually foretell the future by your science.'&nbsp;"
        Cicero, <i>De divinatione,</i> II, 18, 43: "We find it written in our augural
        commentaries: 'It is sacrilege to hold <i>comitia</i> with Jove thundering or
        lightning.' That may have been devised for purposes of state, for our
        forefathers wanted to have some pretext for not holding <i>comitia." Ibid.,</i> II,
        33, 70: "Yet I believe that Romulus, who founded the city in obedience to
        auspices, must have thought that there was a science of augury for
        foretelling the future (antiquity erred in many matters) and we see that
        that belief has remained unshaken whether by experience, by learning, or by
        time. However, the custom and science of divination, the strict observance
        of it, and the prerogatives of the augurs and the prestige of their college,
        have been kept alive in deference to popular feelings, and in view of their
        great advantage to the state." A little later, II, 35, 75, he adds that he
        believed "the augural law to have been first established through belief in
        divination and to have been kept and preserved later on for reasons of
        state." That seems to have been Cicero's
        own opinion and it does not come far from the truth. Non-logical actions
        arise spontaneously. They may then be kept in deference to tradition or
        because of their proved usefulness. Of course any logical origin, by design
        of Romulus, is pure myth. <i>Cf.</i> Aristotle, <i>Metaphysica,</i> XI, 8, 13 (Ross, p.
        1074b). After discussing the divinity of the stars, he adds: "The rest is a
        mythical adjunct, designed to influence the multitude and promote obedience
        to law and the common welfare." See further: Plutarch, <i>De placitis
          philosophorum,</i> I, 7, 2 (Goodwin, Vol. III, p. 119); and Sextus Empiricus,
        <i>Contradictiones,</i> IX, <i>Adversus physicos,</i> II, <i>De diis,</i> 14-16 (551) (<i>Opera,</i>

        As for the God of the Hebrews, see Piepenbring, <i>Théologie de l'Ancien
          Testament,</i> pp. 98-99: "The holiness of God is intimately bound up with His
        jealousy, His wrath, His vengeance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the 'Old Canticle'
        (<i>Ex.</i> 15:7)
        Moses cries out to the Lord: '.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the greatness of thine excellency
        thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy
        wrath, which consumed them as stubble.' [Can any neo-Chrisdan abstraction
        say as much?] The wrath of God breaks out in the form of dire punishment
        every time His will is crossed, disregarded, transgressed." These
        milk-and-water Christians are inclined to think that all that changed with
        the coming of Christ, but such is not the case. The early Church Fathers
        discourse without mincing words on the punishments that will be visited on
        unbelievers. As for the God of St. Paul, one of the many passages will
        suffice: I Cor. 10:8: "Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them
        [the Israelites] committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand
        [Num. 25:1-9]." Can the abstraction concocted by the pseudo-science of the
        neo-Christians pretend to do as much? No! Well, in that case the precept
        will be obeyed by those who are already good Christians, and no one who is
        not will pay any attendon. But that is the essential characteristic of the
        principles (§ <a href="#footnote-0306-01">306</a><sup>1</sup>)
        of non-logical actions. The Apostle continues: "Neither
        let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of
        serpents [Num. 21:4-9]. Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured,
        and were destroyed of the destroyer [Num. 11:16]." And later on, 22, he
        asks: "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He?" Every
        sensible man will answer no if the being in question is an omnipotent God;
        but many sensible men will answer yes if it is a question of an abstraction
        that some few individuals have distilled from their own sentiments.

        Auguste Sabatier, <i>Les religions d'autorité et la religion de l'esprit,</i>
        pp. 440-41 (English translation, pp. 281-82): "The letter, the alphabetic
        sign, characterizes the Mosaic religion in accordance with the form of its
        appearance in history, its manner of being and action.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The letter
        kills. Spirit, instead, characterizes the religion of the Gospel in accord
        with the very nature of the inner moral relationship that it sets up between
        God and man, in accord with the manner of being of the Gospel and the
        principle of its action.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In view of that you must surely understand what
        the religion of the spirit is. It is the religious relationship realized in
        pure spirituality. It is God and man conceived both as spirit and as
        reciprocally permeating each other to the point of attaining complete
        communion. Physical bodies are by definition impenetrable to each other.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        Quite otherwise the relationship between spirits. Their inward tendency is
        to live each other's lives mutually and to combine in a higher common life.
        What the law of gravitation is to the physical world as regards the
        maintenance of its harmony, so love is and so love does in the spiritual and
        moral world. [The conception this gentleman has of the law of gravitation
        would make a story.]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ultimate force in the moral development of the
        human being, the spirit of God no longer constrains him from without but
        determines, animates, him from within, and is the source of his life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
        The fulfilment of natural duties, the regular exercise of all human
        faculties, the progress of enlightenment as well as of justice&mdash;that is
        the perfection of the Christian life. Becoming an inner reality, a fact of
        conscience, Christianity is now nothing more than conscience raised to its
        highest power."

        Brachet, <i>Grammaire historique de la langue française,</i> pp. 293-94
        (Kitchin, pp. 195-96): "Before attaining the degree of exactness that it
        possesses today, etymology, like all the sciences and perhaps more notably
        than any other, traversed a long period of infancy, of gropings, of
        uncertain efforts, during which arbitrary associations, superficial
        analogies, reckless combinations, made up virtually its whole patrimony."
        Here Brachet quotes from Réville, <i>Les ancêtres des européens:</i> "&nbsp;'Abidingly
        famous the day-dreams of Plato in the <i>Cratylus,</i> the absurd etymologies of
        Varro [<i>Etymologiae,</i> Dordrecht, Part III, pp. 165-176] and Quintilian among
        the Romans, the philological fancies of Ménage in France in the seventeenth
        century. People saw nothing strange about connecting <i>jeûne,</i> "fast," with
        <i>jeune,</i> "young." Is not youth the morning of life, and is one not fasting
        when one gets up? Most often two words of entirely different forms were
        derived from each other, the gulf between
        them being bridged by fictional intermediaries. That was the way Ménage got
        the French <i>rat</i> from the Latin <i>mus,</i> "mouse": "People must have said first
        <i>mus,</i> then <i>muratus,</i> then <i>ratus,</i> finally <i>rat."</i>
        It was courageously assumed
        that an object could get its name from a quality opposite to its own,
        affirmation provoking negation, so that Latin <i>lucus,</i> "grove," came from
        <i>non lucere,</i> "not to be bright," because on entering a grove one finds it
        shady.'&nbsp;" Brachet continues: "From such a mass of erudite nonsense how could one of
        the leading sciences eventually arise in our day? By the discovery and
        application of the comparative method, which is the method of the natural
        sciences"&mdash;and the method we are trying to follow in these volumes.

        Here and there in his work Buckle himself ends by making at least
        implicit allusion to non-logical actions. Trying to account for the
        differences between the Puritan Revolution and the French Fronde, he
        suggests, Vol. II, p. 150, "that in England a war for liberty was
        accompanied by a war of classes, while in France there was no war of classes
        at all"; and further, Vol. II, p. 162, that "the object of the [French]
        nobles was merely to find new sources of excitement, and minister to that
        personal vanity for which, as a body, they have always been notorious." Now
        whatever the route that is tried in order to get from such facts to logical
        inferences from an "intellectual principle," it is certain that the facts
        depend on natural inclinations, which cannot be regarded as resulting from
        any differences between the scientific and intellectual attainments of the
        English and the French at that period. No such differences existed.
