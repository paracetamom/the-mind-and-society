  <h2>Contents</h2>

  <h3><a href="01.html">Chapter I. The Scientific Approach</a></h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Statement of points of view. Logico-experimental and non-logical experimental sciences. Differences between them.
    The experimental field is absolutely and in all respects distinct from
    the non-experimental field. In these volumes we are to confine
    ourselves strictly to the experimental field. Our research is essentially relative, essentially contingent, and
    all the propositions we
    enunciate are to be taken as valid only "within the limits of
    time, space and experience known to us." Such a research is
    in process of continuous development; it proceeds by successive
    approximations and in no wise aims at attaining the certain,
    the necessary, the absolute. The language of the logico-experimental and non-logico-experimental sciences and
    ordinary language. Explanation of various terms that are used in these
    volumes. Definitions are mere labels that are used to help us
    keep track of things. Names defined in that way may be replaced at will with letters of the alphabet.
  </div>

  <h3><a href="02.html">Chapter II. Non-Logical Conduct</a></h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Definition and classification of logical and non-logical actions.
    The latter are sometimes admirably adapted to the realization
    of logical purposes. Non-logical action in animals. In human
    beings. Human language. In human beings non-logical impulses
    are sometimes expressed in language. Theology and rites of worship.
    Theories and the facts in which they originate. Different
    intensities in different peoples of the forces that hold certain
    non-logical inclinations together and of the forces that prompt
    innovation. The Romans and the Athenians, the English and
    the French. Mysterious powers that words seem to have over
    things. The extreme limits of theological and metaphysical
    theories. In the manifestations of non-logical impulses there is
    a constant element and an element that is exceedingly variable.
    Example: Weather-magic. Interpretations adapt themselves to the non-logical inclination of people. They show a
    multiple evolution. A first encounter with the necessity of making a sharp
    distinction between the logico-experimental truth of a doctrine
    and its social utility or any other utility that it may have. The
    logical form human beings give to non-logical actions.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter III. Rationalization of Non-Logical Conduct</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">If non-logical actions are of such great importance how have the
    many men of talent who have concerned themselves with
    human societies failed to perceive them? They have perceived
    them, now taking them into account implicitly, now considering
    them under other names without arriving at any general theory,
    now noting the particular case without grasping its general
    bearing. Examples from various authors. The imperfection, from
    the scientific standpoint, of ordinary language tends to promote
    logical interpretations of non-logical conduct. Examples. Human
    beings are somehow prone to shun considering non-logical
    actions and therefore to disguise them with logical vestments of
    one sort or another. Classification of the devices that are used
    for that purpose. Comment on the various categories. The attitude of practical men towards non-logical conduct.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter IV. Theories Transcending Experience</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    The ordinary terms "religion," "morality," "law." Do they
    correspond to anything definite? Study of the term "religion." The
    terms "natural law" and "law of nations." Type-doctrines and,
    deviations from them. The materials that go into theories and
    the nexuses by which they are brought together. Examples. The
    use sociology makes of facts. The unknown has to be explained
    by the known. The present helps to an understanding of the past
    and to some lesser extent the past to understand the present.
    Probability of the conclusions that science reaches. Classification
    of propositions that add something to the uniformity that
    experience reveals, or which ignore it. Study of abstract entities
    known independently of experience.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter V. Pseudo-Scientific Theories</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    How get from a theory to the facts in which it may possibly
    originate? Theories in which abstract entities are explicitly
    referred to origins that lie beyond experience. Summary of the
    results that our induction so far has achieved. The chief one is
    that in non-logico-experimental theories, <i>c</i>, there is a
    quasiconstant element, <i>a</i>, and a very variable element, <i>b</i>. The
    element <i>a</i> is the principle that is functioning in the mind of the
    human being, <i>b</i> is the explanation he gives of it or of the
    conduct which it inspires. Some examples. In theories that add
    something to experience, premises oftentimes are left at least
    partially implicit, yet those premises play a very important role in the
    reasoning that is used to constitute the theory. Efforts that have
    been made to derive doctrines, <i>c</i>, from arbitrary principles, <i>a</i>.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter VI. Residues: Combinations and Group Persistence</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Had we been following a deductive procedure this chapter would have stood first in this work. Resemblances and
    differences, as regards the elements <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, between logico-experimental and non-logico-experimental
    sciences. The
    element <i>a</i> corresponds to certain instincts but is far from covering them all. Furthermore, interests too have
    to be
    considered among the forces determining social forms. Objective and subjective aspects of theories. Examples of a
    technique for distinguishing <i>a</i> from <i>b</i>. We finally assign names (they are quite arbitrary) to the
    things <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>,
    for mere convenience in talking about them: we call the things <i>a</i> "residues," the things <i>b</i>
    "derivations," the things <i>c</i>
    "derivatives." Residues as corresponding to instincts are devoid of any exactness. An analogy between the
    investigations we have been making in social phenomena and investigations in philology. That analogy arises in the
    fact that language is just one among the many social phenomena. Classification of residues. Study of Classes I and
    II.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter VII. Residues: Activity (Self-Expression) and Sociability</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">Study of Classes III and IV.</div>

  <h3>Chapter VIII. Residues: Individual Integrity and Sex</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">Study of Classes V and VI.</div>

  <h3>Chapter IX. Derivations</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Human beings are persuaded chiefly by sentiments (residues). How derivations are evolved. Derivations are used
    both by the non-logico-experimental and the logico-experimental sciences, but the non-logico-experimental sciences
    credit derivations with a capacity to influence the constitution of society directly, whereas the
    logico-experimental
    sciences view them merely as manifestations of the forces that are at work in society. They therefore go looking for
    the forces to which derivations more or less vaguely correspond. The role that we thus ascribe to sentiment has been
    recognized by a number of writers who have dealt with human societies, but not very distinctly. The logic of
    sentiments. The proofs that are offered for derivations are not, oftentimes, the reasons why they win assent.
    Classification of derivations. Study of Classes I, II and III.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter X. Derivations: Verbal Proofs</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">Study of derivations, Class IV.</div>

  <h3>Chapter XI. Properties of Residues and Derivations</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Two problems present themselves: How do residues and derivations function? What bearing do they have, in so
    functioning, on social utilities? The common view is that human conduct depends as a rule on derivations, and to
    some extent at times on sentiments. The fact is that in general derivations result from sentiments and conduct.
    Residues
    as related to the specific individuals in whom they appear. Distribution of residues and changes in society as a
    whole.
    Classes of residues are fairly stable, genera vary somewhat more. The undulatory forms such phenomena assume.
    Relations of residues and derivations to other facts in society. Effects on doctrines of discrepancies between
    residues and logico-experimental principles. Examples. In non-logico-experimental spheres, a strictly logical
    reasoning may lead to conclusions that go far wide of realities, whereas in reasoning illogically under the guidance
    of sentiment, we may come much closer to the facts. Conflicts between theory and practice. How vague indefinite
    derivations are adapted to given purposes. Derivations are normally of scant effect as regards modifying residues.
    How social measures and legal enactments come to be accepted. Myths and, in general, ideals. Ideals and their
    relations
    to other facts in society. Classification of the problems arising under such relationships. Study of the problems.
    What
    relation is there between happiness and one's observance of prevailing norms of religion or morality? Classification
    of the solutions that are commonly offered to this problem. Study of those solutions. That study demonstrates the
    experimental fatuousness of many doctrines, but at the same time their great social utility. Propagation of
    residues. Of derivations. Interests. The economic sphere in society. Pure economics. Applied economics. Instead of
    discarding
    economic theories we are obliged to supplement and improve them. Social heterogeneity and circulation between
    elements in society. <i>Élites</i> and their circulation. Higher and lower class in general.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter XII. The General Form of Society</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    The elements that serve to constitute society. The state of equilibrium. Organization of the social system.
    "Composition" of residues and derivations. Various sorts of interdependence. How they may be taken into the
    reckoning in sociology. Properties of the social system. Utility. Various types of utility. Maximum of utility
    <strong>of</strong> an individual
    or community. Maximum of utility <strong>for</strong> a community. Residues and derivations in their bearing on
    utility. Virtually all
    the reasonings that are used in discussing social problems are derivations. Examples. Composition of utilities,
    residues and derivations. The writing of history. The use of force in society. Ruling and subject classes as regards
    the use of cunning and force. Means the ruling class has at its disposal for defending its rule. Stability and
    change in society. Cycles of interdependence in social phenomena. Protectionism. "Capitalists" are not all of one
    kind.
    "Speculators." Forms of government. Democracy. Governments are efficient in so far as they learn how to utilize
    residues. Efforts to modify residues are very likely to fail. Consent and force as the foundations of governments.
    Modern governments. Demagogic-plutocracy. Costs of the various types of régime. Political parties. Proportions of
    Class I to Class II residues in ruling and subject classes. The economic consequences of the various sorts of
    government. Governments depending primarily upon force. Governments that depend in the main on cunning. Mixed types.
    Economic and social periodicity. The wave-like forms that such phenomena assume. The relation of fluctuations in
    doctrines to fluctuations in the psychic state of society. Common errors in viewing such phenomena. Interdependence
    of waves. Examples. The science of society as a whole.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter XIII. The Social Equilibrium in History</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Proportions of Class I to Class II residues as one of the main factors in the social equilibrium. Indexes of
    social utility. Examples. Equilibrium in the various social strata. Effects that the means used for maintaining that
    equilibrium have
    upon Class I and Class II residues and consequently upon the social equilibrium itself. Examples. Evolution of Roman
    society and analogies with similar developments in modern societies. The trends toward crystallization and free
    initiative are mutually successive phenomena. That is just a particular case of the general law that social
    movements progress in waves.
