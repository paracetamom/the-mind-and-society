  <h2>Contents</h2>

  <h3>Chapter I. The Scientific Approach</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Statement of points of view. Logico-experimental and non-logical experimental sciences. Differences between them.
    The experimental field is absolutely and in all respects distinct from
    the non-experimental field. In these volumes we are to confine
    ourselves strictly to the experimental field. Our research is essentially relative, essentially contingent, and
    all the propositions we
    enunciate are to be taken as valid only "within the limits of
    time, space and experience known to us." Such a research is
    in process of continuous development; it proceeds by successive
    approximations and in no wise aims at attaining the certain,
    the necessary, the absolute. The language of the logico-experimental and non-logico-experimental sciences and
    ordinary language. Explanation of various terms that are used in these
    volumes. Definitions are mere labels that are used to help us
    keep track of things. Names defined in that way may be replaced at will with letters of the alphabet.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter II. Non-Logical Conduct</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Definition and classification of logical and non-logical actions.
    The latter are sometimes admirably adapted to the realization
    of logical purposes. Non-logical action in animals. In human
    beings. Human language. In human beings non-logical impulses
    are sometimes expressed in language. Theology and rites of worship.
    Theories and the facts in which they originate. Different
    intensities in different peoples of the forces that hold certain
    non-logical inclinations together and of the forces that prompt
    innovation. The Romans and the Athenians, the English and
    the French. Mysterious powers that words seem to have over
    things. The extreme limits of theological and metaphysical
    theories. In the manifestations of non-logical impulses there is
    a constant element and an element that is exceedingly variable.
    Example: Weather-magic. Interpretations adapt themselves to the non-logical inclination of people. They show a
    multiple evolution. A first encounter with the necessity of making a sharp
    distinction between the logico-experimental truth of a doctrine
    and its social utility or any other utility that it may have. The
    logical form human beings give to non-logical actions.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter III. Rationalization of Non-Logical Conduct</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">If non-logical actions are of such great importance how have the
    many men of talent who have concerned themselves with
    human societies failed to perceive them? They have perceived
    them, now taking them into account implicitly, now considering
    them under other names without arriving at any general theory,
    now noting the particular case without grasping its general
    bearing. Examples from various authors. The imperfection, from
    the scientific standpoint, of ordinary language tends to promote
    logical interpretations of non-logical conduct. Examples. Human
    beings are somehow prone to shun considering non-logical
    actions and therefore to disguise them with logical vestments of
    one sort or another. Classification of the devices that are used
    for that purpose. Comment on the various categories. The attitude of practical men towards non-logical conduct.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter IV. Theories Transcending Experience</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    The ordinary terms "religion," "morality," "law." Do they
    correspond to anything definite? Study of the term "religion." The
    terms "natural law" and "law of nations." Type-doctrines and,
    deviations from them. The materials that go into theories and
    the nexuses by which they are brought together. Examples. The
    use sociology makes of facts. The unknown has to be explained
    by the known. The present helps to an understanding of the past
    and to some lesser extent the past to understand the present.
    Probability of the conclusions that science reaches. Classification
    of propositions that add something to the uniformity that
    experience reveals, or which ignore it. Study of abstract entities
    known independently of experience.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter V. Pseudo-Scientific Theories</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    How get from a theory to the facts in which it may possibly
    originate? Theories in which abstract entities are explicitly
    referred to origins that lie beyond experience. Summary of the
    results that our induction so far has achieved. The chief one is
    that in non-logico-experimental theories, <i>c</i>, there is a
    quasiconstant element, <i>a</i>, and a very variable element, <i>b</i>. The
    element <i>a</i> is the principle that is functioning in the mind of the
    human being, <i>b</i> is the explanation he gives of it or of the
    conduct which it inspires. Some examples. In theories that add
    something to experience, premises oftentimes are left at least
    partially implicit, yet those premises play a very important role in the
    reasoning that is used to constitute the theory. Efforts that have
    been made to derive doctrines, <i>c</i>, from arbitrary principles, <i>a</i>.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter VI. Residues: Combinations and Group Persistence</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Had we been following a deductive procedure this chapter would have stood first in this work. Resemblances and
    differences, as regards the elements <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, between logico-experimental and non-logico-experimental
    sciences. The
    element <i>a</i> corresponds to certain instincts but is far from covering them all. Furthermore, interests too have
    to be
    considered among the forces determining social forms. Objective and subjective aspects of theories. Examples of a
    technique for distinguishing <i>a</i> from <i>b</i>. We finally assign names (they are quite arbitrary) to the
    things <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>,
    for mere convenience in talking about them: we call the things <i>a</i> "residues," the things <i>b</i>
    "derivations," the things <i>c</i>
    "derivatives." Residues as corresponding to instincts are devoid of any exactness. An analogy between the
    investigations we have been making in social phenomena and investigations in philology. That analogy arises in the
    fact that language is just one among the many social phenomena. Classification of residues. Study of Classes I and
    II.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter VII. Residues: Activity (Self-Expression) and Sociability</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">Study of Classes III and IV.</div>

  <h3>Chapter VIII. Residues: Individual Integrity and Sex</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">Study of Classes V and VI.</div>

  <h3>Chapter IX. Derivations</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Human beings are persuaded chiefly by sentiments (residues). How derivations are evolved. Derivations are used
    both by the non-logico-experimental and the logico-experimental sciences, but the non-logico-experimental sciences
    credit derivations with a capacity to influence the constitution of society directly, whereas the
    logico-experimental
    sciences view them merely as manifestations of the forces that are at work in society. They therefore go looking for
    the forces to which derivations more or less vaguely correspond. The role that we thus ascribe to sentiment has been
    recognized by a number of writers who have dealt with human societies, but not very distinctly. The logic of
    sentiments. The proofs that are offered for derivations are not, oftentimes, the reasons why they win assent.
    Classification of derivations. Study of Classes I, II and III.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter X. Derivations: Verbal Proofs</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">Study of derivations, Class IV.</div>

  <h3>Chapter XI. Properties of Residues and Derivations</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Two problems present themselves: How do residues and derivations function? What bearing do they have, in so
    functioning, on social utilities? The common view is that human conduct depends as a rule on derivations, and to
    some extent at times on sentiments. The fact is that in general derivations result from sentiments and conduct.
    Residues
    as related to the specific individuals in whom they appear. Distribution of residues and changes in society as a
    whole.
    Classes of residues are fairly stable, genera vary somewhat more. The undulatory forms such phenomena assume.
    Relations of residues and derivations to other facts in society. Effects on doctrines of discrepancies between
    residues and logico-experimental principles. Examples. In non-logico-experimental spheres, a strictly logical
    reasoning may lead to conclusions that go far wide o£ realities, whereas in reasoning illogically under the guidance
    of sentiment, we may come much closer to the facts. Conflicts between theory and practice. How vague indefinite
    derivations are adapted to given purposes. Derivations are normally of scant effect as regards modifying residues.
    How social measures and legal enactments come to be accepted. Myths and, in general, ideals. Ideals and their
    relations
    to other facts in society. Classification of the problems arising under such relationships. Study of the problems.
    What
    relation is there between happiness and one's observance of prevailing norms of religion or morality? Classification
    of the solutions that are commonly offered to this problem. Study of those solutions. That study demonstrates the
    experimental fatuousness of many doctrines, but at the same time their great social utility. Propagation of
    residues. Of derivations. Interests. The economic sphere in society. Pure economics. Applied economics. Instead of
    discarding
    economic theories we are obliged to supplement and improve them. Social heterogeneity and circulation between
    elements in society. <i>Élites</i> and their circulation. Higher and lower class in general.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter XII. The General Form of Society</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    The elements that serve to constitute society. The state of equilibrium. Organization o£ the social system.
    "Composition" of residues and derivations. Various sorts of interdependence. How they may be taken into the
    reckoning in sociology. Properties of the social system. Utility. Various types of utility. Maximum of utility
    <strong>of</strong> an individual
    or community. Maximum of utility <strong>for</strong> a community. Residues and derivations in their bearing on
    utility. Virtually all
    the reasonings that are used in discussing social problems are derivations. Examples. Composition of utilities,
    residues and derivations. The writing of history. The use of force in society. Ruling and subject classes as regards
    the use of cunning and force. Means the ruling class has at its disposal for defending its rule. Stability and
    change in society. Cycles of interdependence in social phenomena. Protectionism. "Capitalists" are not all of one
    kind.
    "Speculators." Forms of government. Democracy. Governments are efficient in so far as they learn how to utilize
    residues. Efforts to modify residues are very likely to fail. Consent and force as the foundations of governments.
    Modern governments. Demagogic-plutocracy. Costs of the various types of régime. Political parties. Proportions of
    Class I to Class II residues in ruling and subject classes. The economic consequences of the various sorts of
    government. Governments depending primarily upon force. Governments that depend in the main on cunning. Mixed types.
    Economic and social periodicity. The wave-like forms that such phenomena assume. The relation of fluctuations in
    doctrines to fluctuations in the psychic state of society. Common errors in viewing such phenomena. Interdependence
    of waves. Examples. The science of society as a whole.
  </div>

  <h3>Chapter XIII. The Social Equilibrium in History</h3>
  <div class="chapter-description">
    Proportions of Class I to Class II residues as one of the main factors in the social equilibrium. Indexes of
    social utility. Examples. Equilibrium in the various social strata. Effects that the means used for maintaining that
    equilibrium have
    upon Class I and Class II residues and consequently upon the social equilibrium itself. Examples. Evolution of Roman
    society and analogies with similar developments in modern societies. The trends toward crystallization and free
    initiative are mutually successive phenomena. That is just a particular case of the general law that social
    movements progress in waves.
  </div>

  <h3>Appendix: Index-Summary of Theorems</h3>

  <h2>Chapter I. The Scientific Approach</h2>

  <p id="section-0001">
    <strong>1.</strong> Human society is the subject of many researches. Some of them constitute
    specialized disciplines: law, political economy, political history, the
    history of religions, and the like. Others have not yet been distinguished
    by special names. To the synthesis of them all, which aims at studying human
    society in general, we may give the name of <i>sociology</i>.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0002">
    <strong>2.</strong> That definition is very inadequate. It may perhaps be improved
    upon&mdash;but not much; for, after all, of none of the sciences, not even
    of the several mathematical sciences, have we strict definitions. Nor can we
    have. Only for purposes of convenience do we divide the subject-matter of
    our knowledge into various parts, and such divisions are artificial and
    change in course of time. Who can mark the boundaries between chemistry and
    physics, or between physics and mechanics? And what are we to do with
    thermodynamics? If we locate that science in physics, it will fit not badly
    there; if we put it with mechanics, it will not seem out of place; if we
    prefer to make a separate science of it, no one surely can find fault with
    us. Instead of wasting time trying to discover the best classification for
    it, it will be the wiser part to examine the facts with which it deals. Let
    us put names aside and consider things.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the same way, we have something better to do than to waste our time
    deciding whether sociology is or is not an independent science&mdash;whether
    it is anything but the "philosophy of history" under a different name; or to
    debate at any great length the methods to be followed in the study of
    sociology. Let us keep to our quest for the relationships between social
    facts, and people may then give to that inquiry any name they please. And
    let knowledge of such relationships be obtained by any method that will
    serve. We are interested in the end, and much less or not at all interested
    in the means by which we attain it.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0003">
    <strong>3.</strong> In considering the definition of sociology just above we found it
    necessary to hint at one or two norms that we intend to follow in these
    volumes. We might do the same in other connexions as occasion arises. On the
    other hand, we might very well set forth our norms once and for all. Each of
    those procedures has its merits and its defects. Here we prefer to follow
    the second.<sup><a href="#footnote-0003-01" id="ref-0003-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0004">
    <strong>4.</strong> The principles that a writer chooses to follow may be put forward in two
    different ways. He may, in the first place, ask that his principles be
    accepted as demonstrated truths. If they are so accepted, all their logical
    implications must also be regarded as proved. On the other hand, he may
    state his principles as mere indications of one course that may be followed
    among the many possible. In that case any logical implication which they may
    contain is in no sense demonstrated in the concrete, but is merely
    hypothetical&mdash;hypothetical in the same manner and to the same degree as
    the premises from which it has been derived. It will therefore often be
    necessary to abstain from drawing such inferences: the deductive aspects of
    the subject will be ignored, and relationships be inferred from the facts
    directly. </p>

  <p>
    Let us consider an example. Suppose Euclid's postulate that a straight line
    is the shortest distance between two points is set before us as a theorem.
    We must give battle on the theorem; for if we concede it, the whole system
    of Euclidean geometry stands demonstrated, and we have nothing left to set
    against it. But suppose, on the contrary, the postulate be put forward as a
    hypothesis. We are no longer called upon to contest it. Let the
    mathematician develop the logical consequences that follow from it. If they
    are in accord with the concrete, we will accept them; if they seem not to be
    in such accord, we will reject them. Our freedom of choice has not been
    fettered by any anticipatory concession. Considering things from that point
    of view, other geometries&mdash;non-Euclidean geometries&mdash;are possible,
    and we may study them without in the least surrendering our freedom of
    choice in the concrete.
  </p>

  <p>
    If before proceeding with their researches mathematicians had insisted upon
    deciding whether or not the postulate of Euclid corresponded to concrete
    reality, geometry would not exist even today. And that observation is of
    general bearing. All sciences have advanced when, instead of quarrelling
    over first principles, people have considered results. The science of
    celestial mechanics developed as a result of the hypothesis of the law of
    universal gravitation. Today we suspect that that attraction may be
    something different from what it was once thought to be; but even if, in the
    light of new and better observations of fact, our doubts should prove well
    founded, the results attained by celestial mechanics on the whole would
    still stand. They would simply have to be retouched and supplemented.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0005">
    <strong>5.</strong> Profiting by such experience, we are here setting out to apply to the
    study of sociology the methods that have proved so useful in the other
    sciences. We do not posit any dogma as a premise to our research; and our
    statement of principles serves merely as an indication of that course, among
    the many courses that might be chosen, which we elect to follow. Therefore
    anyone who joins us along such a course by no means renounces his right to
    follow some other. From the first pages of a treatise on geometry it is the
    part of the mathematician to make clear whether he is expounding the
    geometry of Euclid, or, let us say, the geometry of Lobachevski. But that is
    just a hint; and if he goes on and expounds the geometry of Lobachevski, it
    does not follow that he rejects all other geometries. In that sense and in
    no other should the statement of principles which we are here making be
    taken. </p>

  <p id="section-0006">
    <strong>6.</strong> Hitherto sociology has nearly always been expounded dogmatically. Let us
    not be deceived by the word "positive" that Comte foisted upon his
    philosophy. His sociology is as dogmatic as Bossuet's <i>Discourse on Universal
      History</i>. It is a case of two different religions, but of religions
    nevertheless; and religions of the same sort are to be seen in the writings
    of Spencer, De Greef, Letourneau, and numberless other authors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Faith by its very nature is exclusive. If one believes oneself possessed of
    the absolute truth, one cannot admit that there are any other truths in the
    world. So the enthusiastic Christian and the pugnacious free-thinker are,
    and have to be, equally intolerant. For the believer there is but one good
    course; all others are bad. The Mohammedan will not take oath upon the
    Gospels, nor the Christian upon the Koran. But those who have no faith
    whatever will take their oath upon either Koran or Gospels&mdash;or, as a
    favour to our humanitarians, on the <i>Social Contract</i> of Rousseau; nor even
    would they scruple to swear on the <i>Decameron</i> of Boccaccio, were it only to
    see the grimace Senator Berenger would make and the brethren of that
    gentleman's persuasion.<sup><a href="#footnote-0006-01" id="ref-0006-01">1</a></sup> We are by no means asserting
    that sociologies
    derived from certain dogmatic principles are useless; just as we in no sense
    deny utility to the geometries of Lobachevski or Riemann. We simply ask of
    such sociologies that they use premises and reasonings which are as clear
    and exact as possible. "Humanitarian" sociologies we have to
    satiety&mdash;they are about the only ones that are being published
    nowadays. Of metaphysical sociologies (with which are to be classed all
    positive and humanitarian sociologies) we suffer no dearth. Christian,
    Catholic, and similar sociologies we have to some small extent. Without
    disparagement of any of those estimable sociologies, we here venture to
    expound a sociology that is purely experimental, after the fashion of
    chemistry, physics, and other such sciences.<sup><a href="#footnote-0006-02" id="ref-0006-02">2</a></sup> In all
    that follows,
    therefore, we intend to take only experience<sup><a href="#footnote-0006-03" id="ref-0006-03">3</a></sup> and
    observation as our
    guides. So far as experience is not contrasted with observation, we shall,
    for love of brevity, refer to experience alone. When we say that a thing is
    attested "by experience," the reader must add "and by observation."
    When we speak of "experimental sciences," the reader must supply the
    adjective "observational," and so on.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0007">
    <strong>7.</strong> Current in any given group of people are a number of propositions,
    descriptive, preceptive, or otherwise. For example: "Youth lacks
    discretion." "Covet not thy neighbour's goods, nor thy neighbour's wife."
    "Love thy neighbour as thyself." "Learn to save if you would not one day be
    in need." Such propositions, combined by logical or pseudo-logical nexuses
    and amplified with factual narrations<sup><a href="#footnote-0007-01" id="ref-0007-01">1</a></sup> of various sorts,
    constitute theories, theologies, cosmogonies, systems of metaphysics, and so on. Viewed
    from the outside without regard to any intrinsic merit with which they may
    be credited by faith, all such propositions and theories are experimental
    facts, and as experimental facts we are here obliged to consider and examine
    them. </p>

  <p id="section-0008">
    <strong>8.</strong> That examination is very useful to sociology; for the image of social
    activity is stamped on the majority of such propositions and theories, and
    often it is through them alone that we manage to gain some knowledge of the
    forces which are at work in society&mdash;that is, of the tendencies and
    inclinations of human beings. For that reason we shall study them at great
    length in the course of these volumes. Propositions and theories have to be
    classified at the very outset, for classification is a first step that is
    almost indispensable if one would have an adequate grasp of any great number
    of differing objects.<sup><a href="#footnote-0008-01" id="ref-0008-01">1</a></sup> To avoid endless repetition of
    the words
    "proposition" and "theory," we shall for the moment use only the latter
    term; but whatever we say of "theories" should be taken as applying also to
    "propositions," barring specification to the contrary.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0009">
    <strong>9.</strong> For the man who lets himself be guided chiefly by sentiment&mdash;for
    the believer, that is&mdash;there are usually but two classes of theories:
    there are theories that are <em>true</em> and theories that are <em>false</em>. The terms
    "true" and "false" are left vaguely defined. They are felt rather than
    explained. </p>

  <p id="section-0010"><strong>10.</strong> Oftentimes three further axioms are present:
  </p>

  <p>
    1. The axiom that every "honest" man, every "intelligent" human being, <em>must</em>
    accept "true" propositions and reject "false" ones. The person who fails to
    do so is either not honest or not rational. Theories, it follows, have an
    absolute character, independent of the minds that produce or accept them.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. The axiom that every proposition which is "true" is also "beneficial,"
    and <i>vice versa</i>. When, accordingly, a theory has been shown to be true, the
    study of it is complete, and it is useless to inquire whether it be
    beneficial or detrimental.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. At any rate, it is inadmissible that a theory may be beneficial to
    certain classes of society and detrimental to others&mdash;yet that is an
    axiom of modern currency, and many people deny it without, however, daring
    to voice that opinion.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0011">
    <strong>11.</strong> Were we to meet those assertions with contrary ones, we too would be
    reasoning <i>a priori</i>; and, experimentally, both sets of assertions would have
    the same value&mdash;zero. If we would remain within the realm of
    experience, we need simply determine first of all whether the terms used in
    the assertions correspond to some experimental reality, and then whether the
    assertions are or are not corroborated by experimental facts. But in order
    to do that, we are obliged to admit the possibility of both a positive and a negative
    answer; for it is evident that if we bar one of those two possibilities <i>a
      priori</i>, we shall be giving a solution likewise <i>a priori</i> to the problem we
    have set ourselves, instead of leaving the solution of it to experience as
    we proposed doing.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0012">
    <strong>12.</strong> Let us try therefore to classify theories, using the method we would use
    were we classifying insects, plants, or rocks. We perceive at once that a
    theory is not a homogeneous entity, such as the "element" known to
    chemistry. A theory, rather, is like a rock, which is made up of a number of
    elements. In a theory one may detect descriptive elements, axiomatic
    assertions, and functionings of certain entities, now concrete, now
    abstract, now real, now imaginary; and
    all such things may be said to constitute the <em>matter</em> of the theory. But
    there are other things in a theory: there are logical or pseudo-logical
    arguments, appeals to sentiment, "feelings," traces of religious and ethical
    beliefs, and so on; and such things may be thought of as constituting the
    instrumentalities whereby the "matter" mentioned above is utilized in order
    to rear the structure that we call a theory. Here, already, is one aspect
    under which theories may be considered. It is sufficient for the moment to
    have called attention to it.<sup><a href="#footnote-0012-01" id="ref-0012-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0013">
    <strong>13.</strong> In the manner just described, the structure has been reared&mdash;the
    theory exists. It is now one of the objects that we are trying to classify.
    We may consider it under various aspects:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. <em>Objective aspect</em>. The theory may be considered without reference to the
    person who has produced it or to the person who assents to
    it&mdash;"objectively," we say, but without attaching any metaphysical sense
    to the term. In order to take account of all possible combinations that may
    arise from the character of the <i>matter</i> and the character of the <i>nexus</i>, we
    must distinguish the following classes and subclasses:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Class I.</strong></td>
      <td>Experimental matter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>I<i>a</i>.</strong></td>
      <td>Logical nexus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>I<i>b</i>.</strong></td>
      <td>Non-logical nexus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Class II.</strong></td>
      <td>Non-experimental matter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>II<i>a</i>.</strong></td>
      <td>Logical nexus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>II<i>b</i>.</strong></td>
      <td>Non-logical nexus</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    The subclasses I<i>b</i> and II<i>b</i> comprise logical sophistries, or specious
    reasonings calculated to deceive. For the study in which we are engaged they
    are often far less important than the subclasses I<i>a</i> or II<i>a</i>. The subclass I<i>a</i>
    comprises all the experimental sciences; we shall call it
    <i>logico-experimental</i>. Two other varieties may be distinguished in it:
  </p>
  <p>
    I<i>a</i>1, comprising the type that is strictly pure, with the matter strictly
    experimental and the nexus logical. The abstractions and
    general principles that are used within it are derived exclusively from
    experience and are subordinated to experience (§ <a href="#section-0063">63</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    I<i>a</i>2, comprising a deviation from the type, which brings us closer to Class
    II. Explicitly the matter is still experimental, and the nexus logical; but
    the abstractions, the general principles, acquire (implicitly or explicitly)
    a significance transcending experience. This variety might be called
    <i>transitional</i>. Others of like nature might be considered, but they are far
    less important than this one.
  </p>
  <p>
    The classification just made, like any other that might be made, is
    dependent upon the knowledge at our command. A person who regards as
    experimental certain elements that another person regards as
    non-experimental will locate in Class I a proposition that the other person
    will place in Class II. The person who thinks he is using logic and is
    mistaken will class among logical theories a proposition that a person aware
    of the error will locate among the nonlogical. The classification above is a
    classification of types of theories. ln reality, a given theory may be a
    blend of such types&mdash;it may, that is, contain experimental elements and
    non-experimental elements, logical elements and non-logical elements.<sup><a href="#footnote-0013-01"
        id="ref-0013-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    2. <em>Subjective aspect</em>. Theories may be considered with reference to the
    persons who produce them and to the persons who assent to them. We shall
    therefore have to consider them under the following subjective aspects:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>a</i>. <em>Causes in view of which a given theory is devised by a given person</em>. Why
    does a given person assert that <i>A</i> = <i>B</i>? Conversely, if he makes that
    assertion, why does he do so?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>b</i>. <em>Causes in view of which a given person assents to a given theory</em>. Why
    does a given person assent to the proposition <i>A</i> = <i>B</i>? Conversely, if he
    gives such assent, why does he do so?
  </p>
  <p>
    These inquiries are extensible from individuals to society at large.

  </p>


  <p>
    3. <em>Aspect of utility</em>. In this connexion, is important to keep the
    theory distinct from the state of mind, the sentiments, that it reflects.
    Certain individuals evolve a theory because they have certain sentiments;
    but then the theory reacts in turn upon them, as well as upon other
    individuals, to produce, intensify, or modify certain sentiments.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>I.</td>
      <td><em>Utility or detriment resulting from the sentiments reflected by a theory:</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I<i>a</i>.</td>
      <td>As regards the person asserting the theory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I<i>b</i>.</td>
      <td>As regards the person assenting to the theory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>II.</td>
      <td><em>Utility or detriment resulting from a given theory:</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>II<i>a</i>.</td>
      <td>As regards the person asserting the theory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>II<i>b</i>.</td>
      <td>As regards the person assenting to it.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    These considerations, too, are extensible to society at large.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may say, then, that we are to consider propositions and theories under their
    <em>objective</em> and their <em>subjective aspects</em>, and also from the standpoint of
    their individual or social <em>utility</em>. However, the meanings of such terms must
    not be derived from their etymology, or from their usage in common parlance,
    but exclusively in the manner designated later in § <a href="#section-0119">119</a>.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0014">
    <strong>14.</strong> To recapitulate: Given the proposition <i>A</i> = <i>B</i>, we must answer the
    following questions:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. <em>Objective aspect</em>. Is the proposition in accord with experience, or is it
    not? </p>
  <p>
    2. <em>Subjective aspect</em>. Why do certain individuals assert that <i>A</i> = <i>B</i>?
    And why do other individuals believe that <i>A</i> = <i>B</i>?
  </p>
  <p>
    3. <em>Aspect of utility</em>. What advantage (or disadvantage) do the sentiments
    reflected by the proposition <i>A</i> = <i>B</i> have for the person who states it, and
    for the person who accepts it? What advantage (or disadvantage) does the
    theory itself have for the person who puts it forward, and for the person
    who accepts it?
  </p>
  <p>
    In an extreme case the answer to the first question is yes; and then, as
    regards the other question, one adds: "People say (people believe) that <i>A</i> = <i>B</i>, because it is
    <em>true</em>."
    "The sentiments reflected
    in the proposition are beneficial<sup><a href="#footnote-0014-01" id="ref-0014-01">1</a></sup> because true." "The
    theory itself is
    beneficial because true." In this extreme case, we may find that data of
    logico-experimental science are present, and then "true" means in accord
    with experience. But also present may be data that by no means belong to
    logico-experimental science, and in such event "true" signifies not accord
    with experience but something else&mdash;frequently mere accord with the
    sentiments of the person defending the thesis. We shall see, as we proceed
    with our experimental research in chapters hereafter, that the following
    cases are of frequent occurrence in social matters:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>a</i>. Propositions in accord with experience that are asserted and accepted
    because of their accord with sentiments, the latter being now beneficial,
    now detrimental, to individuals or society
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>b</i>. Propositions in accord with experience that are rejected because they are
    not in accord with sentiments, and which, if accepted, would be detrimental
    to society
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>c</i>. Propositions not in accord with experience that are asserted and accepted
    because of their accord with sentiments, the latter being beneficial,
    oftentimes exceedingly so, to individuals or society
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>d</i>. Propositions not in accord with experience that are asserted and accepted
    because of their accord with sentiments, and which are beneficial to certain
    individuals, detrimental to others, and now beneficial, now detrimental, to
    society. </p>
  <p>
    On all that we can know nothing <i>a priori</i>. Experience alone can enlighten
    us. </p>

  <p id="section-0015">
    <strong>15.</strong> After objects have been classified, they have to be examined, and to
    that research we shall devote the next chapters. In Chapters IV and V
    we shall consider theories with special reference to their accord with
    experience and observation. In Chapters VI, VII, and
    VIII we shall study the sentiments in which theories originate. In Chapters
    IX and X we shall consider the ways in which sentiments are reflected in
    theories. In Chapter XI we shall examine the characteristics of the elements
    so detected. And finally in Chapters XII and XIII we shall see the social
    effects of the various elements, and arrive at an approximate concept of
    variations in the forms of society&mdash;the goal at which we shall have
    been aiming all along and towards which all our successive chapters will
    have been leading.<sup><a href="#footnote-0015-01" id="ref-0015-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0016">
    <strong>16.</strong> From the objective standpoint (§ <a href="#section-0013">13</a>), we divided propositions or
    theories into two great classes, the first in no way departing from the
    realm of experience, the second overstepping it in some respect or other.<sup><a href="#footnote-0016-01"
        id="ref-0016-01">1</a></sup>
    If one would reason at all exactly, it is essential to keep those two
    classes distinct, for at bottom they are heterogeneous things that must
    never be in any way confused, and which cannot, either, be compared.<sup><a href="#footnote-0016-02"
        id="ref-0016-02">2</a></sup> Each
    of them has its own manner of reasoning and, in general, its own peculiar
    standard whereby it falls into two divisions, the one comprising
    propositions that are in logical accord with the chosen standard and are
    called true; the other comprising propositions which are not in accord with
    that standard and are called false. The terms "true" and "false," therefore,
    stand in strict dependence on the standard chosen. If one should try to give
    them an absolute meaning, one would be deserting the logico-experimental
    field for the field of metaphysics.
  </p>
  <p>
    The standard of truth for
    propositions of the first class lies in experience and observation only. The
    standard of truth for the second class lies outside objective
    experience&mdash;in some divine revelation; in concepts that the human mind
    finds in itself, as some say, without the aid of objective experience; in
    the universal consensus of mankind, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    There must never be any quarrelling over names. If someone is minded to
    ascribe a different meaning to the terms "truth" and "science," for our part
    we shall not raise the slightest objection. We are satisfied if he
    specifies the sense that he means to give to the terms he uses and
    especially the standard by which he recognizes a proposition as "true" or
    "false." </p>

  <p id="section-0017">
    <strong>17.</strong> If that standard is not specified, it is idle to proceed with a
    discussion that could only resolve itself into mere talk; just as it would
    be idle for lawyers to plead their cases in the absence of a judge. If
    someone asserts that "<i>A</i> has the property <i>B</i>," before going on with the
    discussion we must know who is to judge the controversy between him and
    another person who maintains that "<i>A</i> does not have the property <i>B</i>." If it is
    agreed that the judge shall be objective experience, objective experience
    will then decide whether <i>A</i> has, or does not have, the property <i>B</i>. Throughout
    the course of these volumes, we are in the logico-experimental field. I
    intend to remain absolutely in that field and refuse to depart from it under
    any inducement whatsoever. If, therefore, the reader desires a judge other
    than objective experience, he should stop reading this book, just as he
    would refrain from proceeding with a case before a court to which he
    objected. </p>

  <p id="section-0018">
    <strong>18.</strong> If people disposed to argue the propositions mentioned desire a judge
    other than objective experience, they will do well to declare exactly what
    their judge is to be, and if possible (it seldom is) to make themselves very
    clear on the point!. In these volumes we shall refrain from participating in
    arguments as to the substance of propositions and theories. We are to
    discuss them strictly from the outside, as social facts with which we have
    to deal.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0019">
    <strong>19.</strong> Metaphysicists generally give the name of "science" to knowledge of the
    "essences" of things, to knowledge of "principles." If we accept that
    definition for the moment, it would follow that this" work would be in no
    way scientific. Not only do we refrain from dealing with essences and
    principles: we do not even know the meaning of those terms (§ <a href="#section-0530">530</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Vera, Hegel's French translator, says,<sup><a href="#footnote-0019-01" id="ref-0019-01">1</a></sup> "The notions of
    science and absolute
    science are inseparable. . . . Now if there be an absolute science, it is
    not and cannot be other than philosophy. So philosophy is the common
    foundation of all the sciences, and as it were the common intelligence of
    all intelligences." In this book we refuse to have anything whatever to do
    with such a science, and with those other pretty things that go with it. "The
    absolute (in other words, essence) and unity (in other words, the necessary
    relations of beings) are the two prime conditions of science." Both of them
    will be found missing in these volumes, and we do not even know what they
    may be. We seek the relationships obtaining between things within the limits
    of the space and time known to us, and we ask experience and observation to
    reveal them to us. "Philosophy is at once an explanation and a creation." We
    have neither the desire nor the ability to explain, in Vera's sense of the
    term, much less to create. "The science that knows the absolute and grasps
    the innermost reason of things knows how and why events come to pass and
    beings are engendered [That is something we do not know.], and not only
    knows but in a certain way itself engenders and brings to pass in the very
    fact of grasping the absolute. And indeed we must either deny science, or
    else admit that there is a point where knowledge and being, thought and its
    object, coincide and are identified; and a science of the absolute that
    arose apart from the absolute, and so failed of achieving its real and
    innermost nature, would not be a science of the absolute, or more exactly,
    would not be science at all."
  </p>

  <p id="section-0020">
    <strong>20.</strong> Well said! In that we agree with Vera. If science is what Vera's terms
    describe it as being&mdash;terms as inspiring as they are (to us)
    incomprehensible&mdash;we are not here dealing with science. We are,
    however, dealing with another thing that Vera very well describes in a
    particular case when he says, p. 214, note: "Generally speaking, mechanics
    is just a miscellany of experiential data and mathematical formulae." In
    terms still more general, one might say: "a miscellany of experiential data
    and logical inferences from
    such data." Suppose, for a moment, we call that non-science. Both Vera and
    Hegel are then right in saying that the theories of Newton are not science
    but non-science; and in these volumes I also intend to deal with
    non-science, since my wish is to construct a system of sociology on the
    model of celestial mechanics, physics, chemistry, and other similar
    non-sciences, and eschew entirely the science or sciences of the
    metaphysicists (§§ <a href="#section-0503">503</a>, <a href="#section-0514">514</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0021">
    <strong>21.</strong> A reader might observe: "That granted, why do you continually harp on
    science in the course of your book, since you use the term in the sense of
    non-science? Are you trying in that way to usurp for your non-science a
    prestige that belongs to science alone?"
    I answer that if the word "science" ordinarily meant what the
    metaphysicists say it means, rejecting the thing, I would conscientiously
    reject the word. But that is not the case. Many people, nay, most people,
    think of celestial mechanics, physics, chemistry, and so on as sciences;
    and to call them non-sciences or something else of the sort would, I fear,
    be ridiculous. All the same, if someone is still not satisfied, let him
    prefix a "non-" to the words "science" and "scientific" whenever he meets
    them in these volumes, and he will see that the exposition develops just as
    smoothly, since we are dealing with things and not with words (§ <a href="#section-0119">119</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0022">
    <strong>22.</strong> While metaphysics proceeds from absolute principles to concrete cases,
    experimental science proceeds from concrete cases, not to absolute
    principles, which, so far as it is concerned, do not exist, but to
    general principles, which are brought under principles still more general,
    and so on indefinitely. That procedure is not readily grasped by minds
    accustomed to metaphysical thinking, and it gives rise to not a few
    erroneous interpretations.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0023">
    <strong>23.</strong> Let us note, just in passing, the preconception that in order to know a
    thing its "essence" must be known. To the precise contrary, experimental
    science starts with knowledge of things, to go on, if not to essences, which
    are entities unknown to science, at least to general principles (§§ <a href="#section-0019">19-20</a>).
    Another somewhat similar conception is widely prevalent nowadays in the
    fields of political economy
    and sociology. It holds that knowledge of things can be acquired only by
    tracing their "origins"<sup><a href="#footnote-0023-01" id="ref-0023-01">1</a></sup> (§§ <a
      href="#section-0093">93</a>, <a href="#section-0346">346</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0024">
    <strong>24.</strong> In an attenuated form the preconception requiring knowledge of "essences"
    aims at demonstrating particular facts by means of general principles,
    instead of deriving the general principle from the fact. Just so proof of
    the fact is confused with proof of its causes. For example, observation
    shows the existence of a fact <i>A</i>; and we go on and designate <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i> . . . as
    its probable causes. It is later shown that those causes are not operative,
    and from that the conclusion is drawn that <i>A</i> does not exist. The
    demonstration would be valid if the existence of <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i> . . . had been shown by
    experience and the existence of <i>A</i> inferred from them. It is devoid of the
    slightest value if observation has yielded <i>A</i> directly.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0025">
    <strong>25.</strong> Close kin to the preconception just mentioned is the difficulty some
    people experience in analyzing a situation and studying its various aspects
    separately. We shall have frequent occasion to return to this matter.
    Suffice it here to note that the distinctions drawn above in § <a href="#section-0013">13</a> will not
    be recognized by many people; and if others do indeed accept them
    theoretically, they straightway forget them in actual thinking (§§ <a href="#section-0031">31-32</a>,
    <a href="#section-0817">817</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0026">
    <strong>26.</strong> For people of "living faith" the various characteristics of theories
    designated in § <a href="#section-0013">13</a> often come down to one only. What the believer wants to
    know, and nothing else, is whether the proposition is true or not true. Just
    what "true" means nobody knows, and the believer less than anybody. In a
    general way it seems to indicate accord with the believer's sentiments; but
    that fact is evident only to the person viewing the belief from the outside,
    as a stranger to it&mdash;never to the believer himself. He, as a rule,
    denies the subjective character of his belief. To tell him that it is
    subjective is almost to insult him, for he considers it true in an absolute
    sense. For the same reason he refuses to think of the term "true" apart from
    the meaning he attaches to it, and readily speaks of a truth different
    from experimental truth and superior to it.<sup><a href="#footnote-0026-01" id="ref-0026-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0027">
    <strong>27.</strong> It is idle to continue discussions of that type&mdash;they can only
    prove fruitless and inconclusive&mdash;unless we know exactly what the terms
    that are used mean, and unless we have a criterion to refer to, a judge to
    render judgment in the dispute (§§ <a href="#section-0017">17</a> f.). Is the criterion, the judge, to be
    experience and observation, or is it to be something else? That point has to
    be clearly determined before we can go on. If you are free to choose between
    two judges, you may pick the one you like best to decide your case. But you
    cannot choose them both at the same time, unless you are sure in advance
    that they are both of one mind and one will.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0028">
    <strong>28.</strong> Of that agreement metaphysicists enjoy an <i>a priori</i> certitude, for their
    superexperimental criterion is of such majesty and power that it dominates
    the experimental criterion, which must of necessity accord with it. For a
    similar reason theologians too are certain <i>a priori</i> that the two criteria
    can never fail of accord. We, much more humble, enjoy no such <i>a priori</i>
    enlightenment. We have no knowledge whatever of what <em>must</em> or <em>ought to</em> be. We
    are looking strictly for what <em>is</em>. That is why we have to be satisfied with
    one judge at a time.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0029">
    <strong>29.</strong> From our point of view not even logic supplies <i>necessary</i> inferences,
    except when such inferences are mere tautologies. Logic derives its efficacy
    from experience and from nothing else (§ <a href="#section-0097">97</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-0029-01"
        id="ref-0029-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0030">
    <strong>30.</strong> The human mind is synthetic, and only training in the habit of
    scientific thinking enables a few individuals to distinguish the parts in a
    whole by an analytical process (§ <a href="#section-0025">25</a>). Women especially, and the less
    well-educated among men, often experience an insurmountable difficulty in
    considering the different aspects of a thing separately, one by one. To be
    convinced of that one has only to read a newspaper article before a mixed
    social gathering and then try to discuss one at a time the various aspects
    under which it may be considered. One will notice that one's listeners do
    not follow, that they persist in considering all the aspects of the subject
    all together at one time.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0031">
    <strong>31.</strong> The presence of that trait in the human mind makes it very difficult for
    both the person who is stating a proposition and the person who is listening
    to keep the two criteria, the experimental and the non-experimental,
    distinct. An irresistible force seems always to be driving the majority of
    human beings to confuse them. Many facts of great significance to sociology
    find their explanation in just that, as will be more clearly apparent from
    what follows.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0032">
    <strong>32.</strong> In the natural sciences people have finally realized the necessity of
    analysis in studying the various aspects of a concrete phenomenon&mdash;the
    analysis being followed by a synthesis in getting back from theory to the
    concrete. In the social sciences that necessity is still not grasped by many people.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0033">
    <strong>33.</strong> Hence the very common error of denying the truth of a theory because it
    fails to explain every aspect of a concrete fact; and the same error, under
    another form, of insisting on embracing under one theory all other similar
    or even irrelevant theories.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <i>O</i> in Figure 1 stand for a concrete situation. By analysis we distinguish
    within it a number of facts: <i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>. . . .

      alt="Capital letters P, Q, and R are at the top of the figure. Branching down from P are three lines going to lowercase letters a, b, and c.

  </figure>
  <p>
    The fact <i>c</i> and others like it, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> . . . are brought together under a
    certain theory, under a general principle, <i>P</i>. In the same way, <i>e</i> and facts
    like <i>e</i> (<i>d</i>, <i>f</i> . . .) yield another theory, <i>Q</i>; and the facts <i>g</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>m</i>,
    <i>n</i> . . .
    still another theory, <i>R</i>, and so on. These theories are worked out
    separately; then, to determine the concrete situation <i>O</i>,
    the results (<i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i> . . .) of the various theories are taken together.
    After analysis comes synthesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    People who fail to understand that will say: "The situation <i>O</i> presents not
    only the fact <i>e</i> but also the fact <i>c</i>; therefore the theory <i>Q</i> has to account
    for <i>c</i>." That conclusion is erroneous. One should say&mdash;and it is the
    only sound conclusion: ". . . therefore the theory <i>Q</i> accounts for only a
    part of the situation <i>O</i>."

    <strong>34.</strong> Example: Let <i>Q</i> stand for the theory of political economy. A concrete
    situation <i>O</i> presents not only an economic aspect, <i>e</i>, but the further aspects
    <i>c</i>, <i>g</i> . . . of a sociological character. It is a mistake to include, as many
    have included, the sociological elements <i>c</i>, <i>g</i> . . . under political economy.
    The only sound conclusion to be drawn from the facts is that the economic
    theory which accounts for <i>e</i> must be supplemented (<em>supplemented</em>, not
    replaced) by other theories which account for <i>c</i>, <i>g</i>. . . .

  <p id="section-0035">
    <strong>35.</strong> In political economy itself, the theories of pure or mathematical
    economics have to be supplemented&mdash;not replaced&mdash;by the theories
    of applied economics. Mathematical economics aims chiefly at emphasizing the
    interdependence of economic phenomena. So far no other method has been found
    for attaining that end.<sup><a href="#footnote-0035-01" id="ref-0035-01">1</a></sup>

  <p id="section-0036">
    <strong>36.</strong> Straightway one of those numberless unfortunates who are cursed with the
    mania for talking about things they do not understand comes forward with the
    discovery&mdash;lo the wonders of genius! &mdash;that pure economics is not
    applied economics, and concludes, not that something must be added to pure
    economics if we are to understand concrete phenomena, but that pure
    economics must be replaced by his gabble. Alas, good soul, mathematical
    economics helps, at least, to a rough understanding of the effects of the
    interdependence of economic phenomena, while your gabble shows absolutely
    nothing! </p>

  <p id="section-0037">
    <strong>37.</strong> And lo, another prodigious genius, who holds that because many economic
    phenomena depend on the human will, economics must be replaced by
    psychology. But why stop at psychology? Why not geography, or even
    astronomy? For after all the economic factor
    is influenced by seas, continents, rivers, and above all by the Sun,
    fecundator general of "this fair family of flowers and trees and all earthly
    creatures."<sup><a href="#footnote-0037-01" id="ref-0037-01">1</a></sup> Such prattle has been called
    <i>positive</i>
    economics, and for that
    our best gratitude, for it provokes a laugh, and laughter, good digestion!
  </p>

  <p id="section-0038">
    <strong>38.</strong> Many economists have been inclined to bring each and every sort of
    economic theory under the theory of <em>value</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-0038-01" id="ref-0038-01">1</a></sup>
    True, nearly all economic
    phenomena express themselves in terms of <em>value</em>; but from that we have a
    right to conclude that in isolating the various elements in such phenomena
    we come upon a theory for value&mdash;but not that all other elements have
    to be squeezed into that theory. Nowadays people are going farther still,
    and value is coming to be the door through which sociology is made to elbow
    its way into political economy. Perhaps we ought to be thankful that they
    are stopping at that, for no end of other things might be pushed through the
    same door: psychology, to explain why and how a thing, real or imaginary,
    comes to have value; then physiology as handmaiden to psychology; and
    then&mdash;why not?&mdash;a little biology to explain the foundations of
    physiology; and surely a little mathematics, for after all the first member
    of an equation has the same value as the second and the theory of value
    would not be complete without the theory of equations; and so on forever. In
    all of which there is this much truth: that the concrete situation is very
    complex and may be regarded as a compound of many elements <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>. . . .
    Experience teaches that to understand such a situation it is best to isolate
    the elements <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> . . . and examine them one by one, that we may then
    bring them together again and so get the theory of the complex as a whole.
    That is just what logico-experimental science does. But those who are
    unfamiliar with its methods grope blindly forward, shifting from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>,
    from <i>B</i> to <i>C</i>, then every so often turning back, mixing things up, taking
    refuge in words, thinking of <i>B</i> while studying <i>A</i>, and of something else while
    studying <i>B</i>. Worse yet, if you are looking into <i>A</i> they interrupt to remind
    you of <i>B</i>;
    and if you answer on <i>B</i>, they are off to <i>C</i>, jumping about now here, now
    there, prattling ever beside the point and demonstrating one thing only:
    their helpless innocence of any scientific method.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0039">
    <strong>39.</strong> Those who deny scientific status to political economy argue, in fact, to
    show that it is not adequate to explain concrete phenomena; and from that
    they conclude that it should be ignored in such explanation. The sound
    conclusion would be that other theories should be added to it. Thinking as
    such people think we should have to say that chemistry ought to be ignored
    in agriculture, since chemistry is inadequate to explain everything about a
    farm. Moreover, engineering schools would have to bar pure mathematics, for
    it stands to applied mechanics almost as pure economics stands to applied
    economics. </p>

  <p id="section-0040">
    <strong>40.</strong> Further, it is difficult, in fact almost impossible, to induce people to
    keep mere knowledge of the laws (uniformities) of society distinct from
    action designed to modify them. If someone is keeping strictly to such
    knowledge, people will insist at all costs that he have some practical
    purpose in view. They try to find out what it is, and, there being none, one
    is finally invented for him.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0041">
    <strong>41.</strong> In the same way, it is difficult to induce people not to go beyond what
    an author says and add to the propositions he states others that may seem to
    be implicit in them but which he never had in mind (§§ <a href="#section-0073">73</a> f., <a
      href="#section-0311">311</a>). If you
    note a defect in a given thing <i>A</i>, it is taken for granted that you are
    condemning <i>A</i> as a whole; if you note a good point, that you approve of <i>A</i> as
    a whole. It seems incredibly strange to people that you should be stressing
    its defects if you are not intending to condemn it as a whole, or its
    excellences if you are not approving of it as a whole. The inference would
    be somewhat justified in a case of special pleading, for after all it is not
    the business of the advocate to accuse his client. But it is not a sound
    inference from a plain description of fact, or when a scientist is seeking
    scientific uniformities. The inference would be admissible, further, in the
    case of an argument not of a logico-experimental character but based on
    accord of sentiments (§ <a href="#section-0514">514</a>). In fact, when one is trying to win the
    sympathies of others by such an argument,
    one may be expected to declare one's own sympathies; and if that is not done
    explicitly, people may properly assume that it is done implicitly. But when
    we are reasoning objectively, according to the logico-experimental method,
    we are not called upon to declare our sentiments either explicitly or by
    implication. </p>

  <p id="section-0042">
    <strong>42.</strong> As regards proofs, a person stating a logico-experimental proposition or
    theory (§ <a href="#section-0013">13</a>, I<i>a</i>) asks them of observation, experience, and logical
    inferences from observation and experience. But the person asserting a
    proposition or theory that is not logico-experimental can rely only on the
    spontaneous assent of other minds and on the more or less logical inferences
    he can draw from what is assented to. At bottom he is exhorting rather than
    proving. However, that is not commonly admitted by people using
    non-logico-experimental theories. They pretend to be offering proofs of the
    same nature as the proofs offered for logico-experimental theories; and in
    such pseudo-experimental arguments they take full advantage of the
    indefiniteness of common everyday language.
  </p>
  <p>
    As regards persuasion, proofs are convincing only to minds trained to
    logico-experimental thinking. Authority plays a great part even in
    logico-experimental propositions, though it has no status as proof.
    Passions, accords of sentiment, vagueness of terms, are of great efficacy in
    everything that is not logico-experimental (§ <a href="#section-0514">514</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0043">
    <strong>43.</strong> In the sphere of proof, experience is powerless as against faith, and
    faith as against experience, with the result that each is confined to its
    own domain. If John, an unbeliever, denies that God created Heaven and
    Earth, and you meet him with the authority of the Bible, you have made a
    nice round hole in the water, for he will deny the authority of the Bible
    and your argument will crumble. To replace the authority of the Bible with
    the authority of your "Christian experience" is a childish makeshift, for
    John will reply that his own experience inclines him not in the least to
    agree with you; and if you retort that his experience is not Christian, you
    will have reasoned in a neat circle, for it is certain that if only that
    experience is Christian which leads to your results, one may conclude
    without fear of contradiction that Christian experience leads to your
    results&mdash;and by that we have learned exactly nothing.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0044">
    <strong>44.</strong> When one asserts a logico-experimental proposition (§ <a href="#section-0013">13</a>,
    I<i>a</i>), one can
    place those who contradict in the dilemma of either accepting the
    proposition as true or refusing credence to experience and logic. Anyone
    adopting the latter course would be in the position of John, the unbeliever
    just mentioned: you would have no way of persuading him.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0045">
    <strong>45.</strong> It is therefore evident that, aside as usual from sophistical reasonings
    made in bad faith, the difference as regards proofs between theories that
    are logico-experimental (I<i>a</i>) and theories that are not lies chiefly in the
    fact that in our day in Western countries it is easier to find disbelievers
    in the Koran or the Gospels; in types of experience, whether Christian,
    personal, humanitarian, rational, or of whatever other kind; in the
    categorical imperative; or in the dogmas of positivism, nationalism,
    pacifism, and numberless other things of that brand, than it is to find
    disbelievers in logic and experience. In dealing with other ages and
    countries the situation maybe different.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0046">
    <strong>46.</strong> We are in no sense intending, in company with a certain materialistic
    metaphysics, to exalt logic and experience to a greater power and majesty
    than dogmas accepted by sentiment. Our aim is to distinguish, not to
    compare, and much less to pass judgment on the relative merits and virtues
    of those two sorts of thinking (§ <a href="#section-0069">69</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0047">
    <strong>47.</strong> Again, we have not the remotest intention of bringing back through the
    window a conviction we have just driven out by the door. We in no wise
    assert that the logico-experimental proof is superior to the other and is to
    be preferred. We are saying simply&mdash;and it is something quite
    different&mdash;that such proof alone is to be used by a person concerned
    not to abandon the logico-experimental field.<sup><a href="#footnote-0047-01" id="ref-0047-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0048">
    <strong>48.</strong> The extreme case of a person flatly repudiating all logical discursion,
    all experience, is rarely met with. Logico-experimental
    considerations are commonly enough ignored, left unexpressed, crowded aside,
    by one device or another; but it is difficult to find anyone really
    combating them as enemies. That is why people almost always try to
    demonstrate theories that are not objective, not experimental, by
    pseudo-logical and pseudo-experimental proofs.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0049">
    <strong>49.</strong> All religions have proofs of that type, supplemented as a rule by proofs
    of utility to individual and society. And when one religion replaces
    another, it is anxious to create the impression that its experimental proofs
    are of a better quality than any the declining faith can marshal. Christian
    miracles were held to be more convincing than pagan miracles, and nowadays
    the "scientific" proofs of "solidarity" and humanitarianism are considered
    superior to the Christian miracles. All the same, the man who examines such
    facts without the assistance of faith fails to notice any great difference in
    them: for him they have exactly the same scientific value, to wit, zero.
    We are obliged to believe that "when Punic fury thundered from the
    Thrasimene" the defeat of the Romans was caused by the impious indifference
    of the consul Flaminius to the portents sent of the gods. The consul had
    fallen from his horse in front of the statue of Jupiter Stator. The sacred
    chickens had refused to eat. Finally, the legionary ensign had stuck in the
    ground and could not be extricated.<sup><a href="#footnote-0049-01" id="ref-0049-01">1</a></sup> We shall also be
    certain (whether more
    or less certain, I could not say) that the victory of the Crusaders at
    Antioch was due to the divine protection concretely symbolized in the Holy
    Lance.<sup><a href="#footnote-0049-02" id="ref-0049-02">2</a></sup> Then again it
    is certain, in fact the height of certitude, because attested by a better
    and more modern religion, that Louis XVI of France lost his throne and his
    life simply because he did not love to the degree required his good, his
    darling, people. The humanitarian god of democracy never suffers such
    offences to go unpunished!
  </p>

  <p id="section-0050">
    <strong>50.</strong> Experimental science has no dogmas, not even the dogma that experimental
    facts can be explained only by experience. If the contrary were seen to be
    the case, experimental science would accept the fact, as it accepts every
    other fact of observation. And it in truth accepts the proposition that
    inventions may at times be promoted by non-experimental principles, and does
    so because that proposition is in accord with the results of experience.<sup><a href="#footnote-0050-01"
        id="ref-0050-01">1</a></sup>
    But so far as demonstration goes, the history of human knowledge clearly
    shows that all attempts to explain natural phenomena by means of
    propositions derived from religious or metaphysical principles have
    failed. Such attempts have finally been abandoned in astronomy, geology,
    physiology, and all other similar sciences. If traces of them are still to
    be found in sociology and its subbranches, law, political economy, ethics,
    and so on, that is simply because in those fields a strictly scientific
    status has not yet been attained.<sup><a href="#footnote-0050-02" id="ref-0050-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0051">
    <strong>51.</strong> One of the last efforts to subordinate experience to metaphysics was
    made by Hegel in his <i>Philosophy of Nature</i>, a work which, in all frankness,
    attains and oversteps the limits of comic absurdity.<a href="#footnote-0051-01"
      id="ref-0051-01"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0052">
    <strong>52.</strong> On the other hand, in our day people are beginning to repudiate dogmas
    that usurp status as experimental science. Sectarians of the humanitarian
    cult are wont to meet the "fictions" of the religion they are combating with
    the "certainty" of science. But that "certainty" is just one of their
    preconceptions. Scientific theories are
    mere hypotheses, which endure so long as they accord with the facts and
    which die and vanish from the scene as new investigations
    destroy that accord. They are then superseded by new ones for which a
    similar fate is held in store (§ <a href="#section-0022">22</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0053">
    <strong>53.</strong> Let us assume that a certain number of facts are given. The problem of
    discovering their theory may be solved in more than one way. A number of
    theories may satisfy the data equally well, and the choice between them may
    sometimes be determined by subjective considerations, such as preference for
    greater simplicity (§ <a href="#section-0064">64</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0054">
    <strong>54.</strong> In both logico-experimental (I<i>a</i>) and non-logico-experimental theories,
    one gets certain general propositions called "principles," logically
    deducible from which are inferences constituting theories. Such principles
    differ entirely in character in the two kinds of theories mentioned.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0055">
    <strong>55.</strong> In logico-experimental theories (I<i>a</i>) principles are nothing but
    abstract propositions summarizing the traits common to many
    different facts. The principles depend on the facts, not the facts on the
    principles. They are governed by the facts, not the facts by them. They are
    accepted hypothetically only so long and so far as they are
    in agreement with the facts; and they are rejected as soon as there is
    disagreement (§ <a href="#section-0063">63</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0056">
    <strong>56.</strong> But scattered through non-logico-experimental theories one finds
    principles that are accepted <i>a priori</i>, independently of experience,
    dictating to experience. They do not depend upon the facts; the facts depend
    upon them. They govern the facts; they are not governed by them. They are
    accepted without regard to the facts, which must of necessity accord with
    the inferences deducible from the principles; and if they seem to disagree,
    one argument after another is tried until one is found that successfully
    re-establishes the accord, which can never under any circumstances fail.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0057">
    <strong>57.</strong> In order of time, the grouping of theories as given in § <a href="#section-0013">13</a> has in
    many cases to be reversed. In history, that is, non-logico-experimental theories
    often come first, the logico-experimental (I<i>a</i>) afterwards.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0058">
    <strong>58.</strong> The subordination of facts to principles in non-logico-experimental
    theories is manifested in a number of ways:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. People are so sure of the principles with which they start that
    they do not even take the trouble to inquire whether their implications
    are in accord with experience. Accord there must be, and experience as the
    subordinate cannot, must not, be allowed to talk back to its superior.<sup><a href="#footnote-0058-01"
        id="ref-0058-01">1</a></sup>
    That is the case especially when logico-experimental theories (I<i>a</i>) begin to
    invade a domain that has been pre-empted by non-logico-experimental
    theories. </p>
  <p>
    2. As that invasion gains headway, progress in the experimental sciences
    finally rescues them from the servitude to which they were regarded as
    sternly subject. They are conceded a measure of autonomy; they are permitted
    to verify the inferences drawn from traditional principles, though people
    continue to assert that verification always corroborates the principle. If
    things seem not to turn out that way, casuistry comes to the rescue to
    re-establish the desired accord.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. When finally that method of maintaining the sovereignty of the general
    principles also fails, the experimental sciences are resignedly allowed to
    enjoy their hard-won independence; but their domain is now represented as of
    an inferior order envisaging the relative and the particular, whereas
    philosophical principles contemplate the absolute, the universal.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0059">
    <strong>59.</strong> No departure from the experimental field and therefore from the domain
    of logico-experimental theories (I<i>a</i>) is involved in the resort to
    hypotheses, provided they are used strictly as instruments in the quest for
    consequences that are uniformly subject to verification by experience. The
    departure arises when hypotheses are used as instruments of proof without
    reference to experimental verification. The hypothesis of gravitation, for
    instance, does not carry us outside the experimental field so long as we
    understand that its implications
    are at all times subject to experience, as modern physics always assumes. It
    would carry us outside the experimental field were we to declare gravitation
    an "essential property" of "matter" and assert that the orbits of the stars
    must of necessity comply with the Newtonian law. That distinction was not
    grasped by writers such as Comte, who tried to bar the hypothesis of a
    luminous ether from science. That hypothesis and others of the kind are to
    be judged not intrinsically but extrinsicallv, that is, by ascertaining
    whether and to what extent inferences drawn from them accord with the facts.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0060">
    <strong>60.</strong> When any considerable number of inferences from a given hypothesis have
    been verified by experience, it becomes exceedingly probable that a new
    implication will likewise be verified; so in that case the two types of
    hypotheses mentioned in §§ <a href="#section-0055">55</a> and <a href="#section-0056">56</a> are inclined to blend,
    and in practice
    there is the temptation to accept the new inference without verifying it.
    That explains the haziness present in many minds as to the distinction
    between hypotheses subordinate to experience and hypotheses dominating
    experience. Still, as a matter of practice there are cases where the
    implications of this or that hypothesis may be accepted without proof. For
    instance, certain principles of pure mechanics are being questioned
    nowadays, at least as regards velocities to any considerable degree greater
    than velocities practically observable. But it is evident that the
    mechanical engineer may continue to accept them without the slightest fear
    of going wrong, since the parts of his machines move at speeds which fall
    far short of any that would require modifications in the principles of
    dynamics. </p>

  <p id="section-0061">
    <strong>61.</strong> In pure economics my hypothesis of "ophelimity" (§ <a href="#section-2110">2110</a>) remains
    experimental so long as inferences from it are held subject to verification
    on the facts. Were that subordination to cease, the hypothesis could no
    longer be called experimental. Walras did not think of his "exchange value"
    in any such manner.<sup><a href="#footnote-0061-01" id="ref-0061-01">1</a></sup> If one drops the
    hypothesis of ophelimity, as is possible by observing curves of indifference
    (§ <a href="#footnote-2408-01">2408<sup>1</sup></a>)
    or by some other device of the kind, one is excused from verifying
    experimentally the implications of a hypothesis that is no longer there.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0062">
    <strong>62.</strong> Likewise, the hypothesis of value remains experimental so long as value
    is thought of as something leading to inferences that are experimentally
    verifiable. It ceases to be experimental when value is taken as a
    metaphysical entity presumably superior to experimental verification (§
    <a href="#section-104">104</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-0062-01" id="ref-0062-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0063">
    <strong>63.</strong> In the logico-experimental sciences, if they are to be kept strictly
    such, so-called general principles are, as we said above (§ <a href="#section-0055">55</a>), nothing but
    hypotheses designed to formulate syntheses of facts linking facts under
    theories and epitomizing them. Theories, their principles, their
    implications, are altogether subordinate to facts and possess no other
    criterion of truth than their capacity for picturing them. That is an exact
    reversal of the relations between general principles and experimental facts
    that obtain in non-logico-experimental theories (§ <a href="#section-0013">13</a>, Class II). But the
    human mind has such a predilection for theories of that sort that general
    principles have often been seen to recover sovereignty even over theories
    aspiring to status as logico-experimental (I<i>a</i>). It was agreed, that is, that
    principles had a
    quasi-independent subsistence, that only one theory was true, while numberless
    others were false, that experience could indeed determine which theory was
    true, but that, having done that much, it was called upon to submit to the
    theory. In a word, general principles, which were lords by divine right in
    non-logico-experimental theories (§ <a href="#section-0016">16</a>), became lords by election, but lords
    nevertheless, in logico-experimental theories (I<i>a</i>). So we get the two
    subclasses distinguished in § <a href="#section-0013">13</a>; but it is well to note that oftentimes
    their traits are implicit rather than explicit, that is, general principles
    are used without explicit declaration as to just how they are regarded.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0064">
    <strong>64.</strong> Steady progress in the experimental sciences eventually brought about
    the downfall of this elective sovereignty as well, and so led to strictly
    logico-experimental theories (I<i>a</i>1), in which general principles are mere
    abstractions devised to picture facts, it being meantime recognized that
    different theories may be equally true (§ <a href="#section-0053">53</a>), in the sense that they
    picture the facts equally well and that choice among them is, within certain
    limits, arbitrary. In a word, one might say that we have reached the extreme
    of Nominalism,
    provided that term be stripped of its metaphysical connotations.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0065">
    <strong>65.</strong> For the very reason that we intend to remain strictly within
    logico-experimental bounds, we are not called upon to solve the
    metaphysical problem of Nominalism and Realism.<sup><a href="#footnote-0065-01" id="ref-0065-01">1</a></sup> We do
    not presume
    to decide whether only the <i>individuum</i>, or only the <em>species</em>, exists, for the
    good reason, among others, that we are not sufficiently clear as to the
    precise meaning of the term "exist." We intend to study things and hence
    <i>individua</i>, and to consider species as aggregates of more or less similar
    things on which we determine ourselves for specified purposes. Farther than
    that we choose not to go just
    here, though without prejudice to anybody's privilege of going beyond the
    point at which we stop.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0066">
    <strong>66.</strong> The fact that we deal with <i>individua</i> by no means implies that a number
    of <i>indiuidua</i> taken together are to be considered a simple sum. They form
    compounds which, like chemical compounds, may have properties that are not
    the sum of the properties of their components.

    theological, metaphysical, or pseudo-experimental may be of great importance
    from certain points of view; but it is of no importance whatever from the
    standpoint of the logico-experimental sciences. St. Augustine denies the
    existence of antipodes because Scripture makes no mention of them.<sup><a href="#footnote-0067-01"
        id="ref-0067-01">1</a></sup> In
    general, the Church Fathers find all their criteria of truths, even of
    experimental truths, in Holy Writ. Metaphysicists make fun of them and
    replace their theological principles with other principles just as remote
    from experience. Scientists who came after Newton, forgetting that he had
    wisely halted at the dictum that celestial bodies moved <em>as if</em> by mutual
    attraction according to a certain law, saw in that law an absolute
    principle, divined by human intelligence, verified by experience, and
    presumably governing all creation eternally. But the principles of mechanics
    have of late been subjected to searching criticism, and the conclusion has
    been reached that only facts and the equations that picture them can stand.
    Poincaré judiciously observes that from the very fact that
    certain phenomena admit of a mechanical explanation, they admit also of
    an indefinite number of other explanations.

    <strong>68.</strong> All the natural sciences to a greater or lesser extent are
    approximating the logico-experimental type (I<i>a</i>1). We intend to study
    sociology in just that fashion, trying, that is, to reduce it to the same
    type (§§ <a href="#section-0006">6</a>, <a href="#section-0486">486</a>, <a href="#section-0514">514</a><sup><a
        href="#footnote-0514-02">2</a></sup>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0069">
    <strong>69.</strong> The course we elect to pursue in these volumes is therefore the
    following:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. We intend in no way to deal with the intrinsic "truth" of any
    religion or faith, or of any belief, whether ethical, metaphysical, or
    otherwise, and we adopt that resolve not in any scorn for such beliefs, but
    just because they lie beyond the limits within which we have chosen to
    confine ourselves. Religions, beliefs, and the like we consider strictly
    from the outside as social facts, and altogether apart from their intrinsic
    merits. The proposition that "<i>A</i> <em>must</em><sup><a href="#footnote-0069-01" id="ref-0069-01">1</a></sup> be
    equal to <i>B</i>" in virture of some higher
    superexperimental principle escapes our examination entirely (§ <a href="#section-0046">46</a>); but we
    do want to know how that belief arose and developed and in what
    relationships it stands to other social facts.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. The field in which we move is therefore the field of experience and
    observation strictly. We use those terms in the meanings they have in the
    natural sciences such as astronomy, chemistry, physiology, and so on, and
    not to mean those other things which it is the fashion to designate by the
    terms "inner" or "Christian" experience, and which revive, under barely
    altered names, the "introspection" of the older metaphysicists. Such
    introspection we consider as a strictly objective fact, as a social fact,
    and not as otherwise concerning us.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Not intruding on the province of others, we cannot grant that others are
    to intrude on ours.<sup><a href="#footnote-0069-02" id="ref-0069-02">2</a></sup> We deem it inept and idiotic to set
    up experience
    against principles transcending experience: but we likewise deny any
    sovereignty of such principles over experience.<sup><a href="#footnote-0069-03" id="ref-0069-03">3</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    4. We start with facts to work out theories, and we try at all times to
    stray from the facts as little as possible. We do not know what the
    "essences" of things are (§§ <a href="#section-0019">19</a>, <a href="#section-0091">91</a>, <a
      href="#section-0530">530</a>) and we ignore them, since that
    investigation oversteps our field (§ <a href="#section-0091">91</a>). We are looking for the
    uniformities presented by facts,<sup><a href="#footnote-0069-04" id="ref-0069-04">4</a></sup> and those uniformities
    we may even call
    laws (§ <a href="#section-0099">99</a>); but the facts are not subject to the laws: the laws are subject
    to the facts. Laws imply no <em>necessity</em> (§§ <a href="#section-0029">29</a>, <a href="#section-0097">97</a>).
    They are hypotheses
    serving to epitomize a more or less extensive number of facts and so serving
    only until superseded by better ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Every inquiry of ours, therefore, is contingent, relative, yielding
    results that are just more or less probable, and at best very highly
    probable. The space we live in seems actually to be three-dimensional; but
    if someone says that the Sun and its planets are one day to sweep us into a
    space of four dimensions, we shall neither agree nor disagree. When
    experimental proofs of that assertion are brought to us, we shall examine
    them, but until they are, the problem does not interest us. Every
    proposition that we state, not excluding propositions in pure logic, must be
    understood as qualified by the restriction <em>within the limits of the time and
      experience known to us</em> (§ <a href="#section-0097">97</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    6. We argue strictly on things and not on the sentiments that the
    names of things awaken in us. Those sentiments we study as objective facts
    strictly. So, for example, we refuse to consider whether an action be
    "just" or "unjust," "moral" or "immoral," unless the things, to which such
    terms refer have been clearly specified. Wey shall, however, examine as an
    objective fact what people of a given social class, in a given country, at a
    given time, meant when they said that <i>A</i> was a "just" or a "moral" act. We
    shall see what their motives were, and how oftentimes the more important
    motives have done their work unbeknown to the very people who were inspired
    by them; and we shall try to determine the relationships between such facts
    and other social facts. We shall avoid arguments involving terms lacking in
    exactness (§ <a href="#section-0486">486</a>), because from inexact premises only inexact conclusions
    can be drawn.<sup><a href="#footnote-0069-05" id="ref-0069-05">5</a></sup> But such arguments we
    shall examine as social facts; indeed, we have in mind to solve a very
    curious problem as to how premises altogether foreign to reality sometimes
    yield inferences that come fairly close to reality (Chapter XI).
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Proofs of our propositions we seek strictly in experience and
    observation, along with the logical inferences they admit of, barring all
    proof by accord of sentiments, "inner persuasion," "dictate of conscience."
  </p>
  <p>
    8. For that reason in particular we shall keep strictly to terms
    corresponding to things, using the utmost care and endeavour to have them as
    definite as possible in meaning (§ <a href="#section-0108">108</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    9. We shall proceed by <em>successive approximations</em>. That is to say, we shall
    first consider things as wholes, deliberately ignoring details. Of the
    latter we shall then take account in successive approximations
    (§ <a href="#section-0540">540</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-0069-06" id="ref-0069-06">6</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0070">
    <strong>70.</strong> We in no sense mean to imply that the course we follow is <i>better</i> than
    others, for the reason, if for no other, than the term "better" in this case
    has no meaning. No comparison is possible between theories altogether
    contingent and theories recognizing an absolute. They are heterogeneous
    things and can never be brought together (§ <a href="#section-0016">16</a>). If someone chooses to
    construct a system of sociology starting with this or that theological or
    metaphysical principle or, following a contemporary fashion, with the
    principles of "progressive democracy," we shall pick no quarrel with him,
    and his work we shall certainly not disparage. The quarrel will not become
    inevitable until we are asked in the name of those principles to accept some
    conclusion that falls within the domain of experience and observation. To go
    back to the case of St. Augustine: When he asserts that the Scriptures are
    inspired of God, we have no objection to the proposition, which we do not
    comprehend very clearly to begin with. But when he sets out to prove by the
    Scriptures that there are no antipodes (§ <a href="#section-0485">485</a>), we have no interest in his
    arguments, since jurisdiction in the premises belongs to experience and
    observation.<sup><a href="#footnote-0070-01" id="ref-0070-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0071">
    <strong>71.</strong> We move in a narrow field, the field, namely, of experience
    and observation. We do not deny that there are other fields, but in these
    volumes we elect not to enter them. Our purpose is to discover theories that
    picture facts of experience and observation (§ <a href="#section-0486">486</a>), and in these volumes
    we refuse to go beyond that. If anyone is minded to do so, if anyone craves
    an excursion outside the logico-experimental field, he should seek other
    company and drop ours, for he will find us disappointing.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0072">
    <strong>72.</strong> We differ
    radically from many people following courses similar to ours in that we do
    not deny the social utility of theories unlike our own. On the contrary we
    believe that in certain cases they may be very beneficial. Correlation of
    the social utility of a theory with its experimental truth is, in fact, one
    of those <i>a priori</i> principles which we reject (§ <a href="#section-0014">14</a>). Do the two things always
    go hand in hand, or do they not? Observation of facts alone can answer the
    question; and the pages which follow will furnish proofs that the two things
    can, in certain cases, be altogether unrelated.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0073">
    <strong>73.</strong> I ask the reader to bear in mind, accordingly, that when I call a
    doctrine absurd, in no sense whatever do I mean to imply that it is
    detrimental to society: on the contrary, it may be very beneficial.
    Conversely, when I assert that a theory is beneficial to society, in no wise
    do I mean to imply that it is experimentally true. In short, a doctrine may
    be ridiculed on its experimental side and at the same time respected from
    the standpoint of its social utility. And <i>vice versa</i>.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0074">
    <strong>74.</strong> In general, when I call attention to some untoward consequence of a
    thing <i>A</i>, indeed one very seriously so, in no way do I mean to imply that <i>A</i>
    on the whole is detrimental to society; for there may be good effects to
    overbalance the bad. Conversely, when I call attention to a good effect of
    <i>A</i>, great though it be, I do not at all imply that on the whole <i>A</i> is
    beneficial to society.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0075">
    <strong>75.</strong> The warning I have just given I had to give, for in general people
    writing on sociology for purposes of propaganda and with ideals to defend
    speak in unfavourable terms alone of things they consider bad on the whole,
    and favourably of things they consider good on the whole. Furthermore, since
    to a greater or lesser extent
    they use arguments based on accords of sentiment (§§ <a href="#section-0041">41</a>, <a
      href="#section-0514">514</a>), they are
    induced to manifest their own sympathies in order to win the sympathies of
    others. They look at facts with not altogether indifferent eyes. fThey love
    and they hate, and they disclose their loves and their hates, their likes
    and dislikes. Accustomed to that manner of doing and saying, a reader very
    properly concludes that if a writer speaks unfavourably of a thing and
    stresses one or another of its defects, that means that on the whole he
    judges it bad and is unfavourably disposed towards it; whereas if he speaks
    favourably of a thing and stresses one or another of its good points, on the
    whole he deems it good and is favourably disposed towards it. That rule does
    not apply to this work; and I shall feel obliged to remind the reader of
    that fact over and over again (§ <a href="#section-0311">311</a>). In these volumes I am reasoning
    objectively, analytically, according to the logico-experimental method. In
    no way am I called upon to make known such sentiments as I may happen to
    cherish, and the objective judgment I pass upon one aspect of a thing in
    no sense implies a similar judgment on the thing considered
    synthetically as a whole.<sup><a href="#footnote-0075-01" id="ref-0075-01">1</a></sup>

  <p id="section-0076">
    <strong>76.</strong> If one person would persuade another on
    matters pertaining
    to experimental science, he chiefly and, better yet, exclusively, states
    facts and logical implications of facts (§ <a href="#section-0042">42</a>). But if he would persuade
    another on matters pertaining to what is still called social science, his
    chief appeal is to sentiments, with a supplement of facts and logical
    inferences from facts. And he must proceed in that fashion if his idea is
    to talk not in vain; for if he were to disregard sentiments, he would
    persuade very few and in all probability fail to get a hearing at all,
    whereas if he knows how to play deftly on sentiments, his reputation for
    eloquence will soar (§ <a href="#section-0514">514</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-0076-01"

  <p id="section-0077">
    <strong>77.</strong> Political economy has hitherto been a practical discipline designed to
    influence human conduct in one direction or another. It could hardly be
    expected, therefore, to avoid addressing sentiment, and in fact it has not
    done so. All along economists have given us systems of ethics supplemented
    in varying degree with narrations of facts and elaborations of the logical
    implications of facts. That is strikingly apparent in the writings of
    Bastiat; but it is apparent enough in virtually all writings on economics,
    not excluding works of the historical school, which are oftentimes more
    metaphysical and sentimental than the rest. As mere examples of forecasts
    based on the scientific laws of political economy and sociology (to the
    exclusion of sentiment), I offer the following. The first volume of my <i>Cours</i>
    appeared in the year 1896, but had been written in 1895, with statistical
    tables coming down not later than the year 1894.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Contrarily to the views of ethical sociologists, whether of the
    historical school or otherwise, and of sentimental anti-Malthusians, at that
    time I wrote with reference to population increase: "We are therefore
    witnessing rates of increase in our day that cannot have obtained in times
    past and cannot continue to hold in the future."<sup><a href="#footnote-0077-01" id="ref-0077-01">1</a></sup> And I
    mentioned in that
    connexion the examples of England and Germany. As for England, there were
    already signs of a slackening. Not so for Germany, where there were as yet
    no grounds, empirically, for arriving at any conclusions whatever. But now both countries
    show a declining curve.<sup><a href="#footnote-0077-02" id="ref-0077-02">2</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    2. With specific reference to England, after determining the law of
    population increase for the years 1801-91, I concluded that
    popu lation could not continue to increase at the same rate. And the rate has in
    fact fallen.<sup><a href="#footnote-0077-03" id="ref-0077-03">3</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    3. "The gains made by certain Socialistic ideas in England are probably the
    result of an increment in the economic obstacles to population increase."<sup><a href="#footnote-0077-04"
        id="ref-0077-04">4</a></sup>
    The soundness of that conclusion is even more apparent now. Socialism has
    progressed in England, while a falling-off has been observable in the other
    countries in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. In Chapter XII we shall see a verification of a sociological law that I
    used in my <i>Systèmes socialistes</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. The second volume of my <i>Cours</i> was published in 1897. At that
    time it was an article of faith with many people that social evolution was
    in the direction of the rich growing richer and the poor, poorer. Contrarily
    to that sentimental view, the law of distribution of income led to the
    proposition<sup><a href="#footnote-0077-05" id="ref-0077-05">5</a></sup>
    that "if total income increases with respect to population,
    there must be either an increase in the minimum income, or a decrease in
    inequality in incomes, or the two things must result simultaneously."
    Between 1897 and 1911 there was an increase in total income as compared with
    population, and what in fact resulted was an increase in minimum income and
    a decrease in inequality in
    incomes.<sup><a href="#footnote-0077-06" id="ref-0077-06">6</a></sup>
    A counter-proof, furthermore, is
    available in the fact that my <i>Cours</i> is defective in those sections into
    which sentiment was allowed to intrude.<sup><a href="#footnote-0077-07" id="ref-0077-07">7</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0078">
    <strong>78.</strong> A person often accepts a proposition for no other reason than that it accords
    with his sentiments. Such accord, indeed, usually makes a proposition more
    "obvious." And from the standpoint of social utility in many cases it is
    perhaps well that that be so. But from the standpoint of experimental
    science, such accord has little value and often none whatever. Of that I
    shall give many examples.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0079">
    <strong>79.</strong> Since I intend in these volumes to take my stand strictly within the
    field of experimental science, I shall try to avoid any appeal to the
    reader's sentiments whatsoever and keep to facts and implications of facts.<sup><a href="#footnote-0079-01"

    <strong>80.</strong>
    When a writer is "doing literature" or addressing sentiments in any way
    at all, he finds it necessary, in deference to them, to choose between the
    facts he uses. Not all of them rise to the dignity of rhetorical or
    historical propriety. There is an aristocracy of facts reference to which is
    always commendable. There is a commonalty of facts reference to which incurs
    neither praise nor blame. There is a proletariat of facts reference to which
    is at all times improper
    and reprehensible. So amateur entomologists may find it pleasant to catch
    bright-coloured butterflies, just routine to catch flies and wasps,
    loathsome to lay hand to dung- and carrion-beetles. But the naturalist knows
    no such distinctions, nor do they arise for us in the field of social
    science (§§ <a href="#section-0085">85</a>, <a href="#section-0896">896</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0081">
    <strong>81.</strong> We keep open house to all facts, whatever their character, provided
    that directly or indirectly they point the way to discovering a uniformity.
    Even an absurd, an idiotic argument is a fact, and if accepted by any large
    number of people, a fact of great importance to sociology. Beliefs, whatever
    their character, are also facts, and their importance depends not on their
    intrinsic merits, but on the greater or fewer numbers of individuals who
    profess them. They serve furthermore to reveal the sentiments of such
    individuals, and sentiments are among the most important elements with which
    sociology is called upon to deal (§ <a href="#section-0069">69</a>-6).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0082">
    <strong>82.</strong>
    The reader must bear that in mind, as he encounters in these volumes
    facts which at first blush might seem insignificant or childish. Tales,
    legends, the fancies of magic or theology, may often be accounted idle and
    ridiculous things&mdash;and such they are, intrinsically; but then again
    they may be very helpful as tools for discovering the thoughts and feelings
    of men. So the psychiatrist studies the ravings of the lunatic not for their
    intrinsic worth but for their value as symptoms of disease.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0083">
    <strong>83.</strong>
    The road that is to lead us to the uniformities we seek may at times
    seem a long one. If that is the case, it is simply because I have not
    succeeded in finding a shorter. If someone manages to do so, all the better;
    I will straightway leave my road for his. Meantime I deem it the wiser part
    to push on along the only trail as yet blazed.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0084">
    <strong>84.</strong>
    If one's aim is to inspire or re-enforce certain sentiments in men, one
    must present facts favourable to that design and keep unfavourable data
    quiet. But if one is interested strictly in uniformities, one must not
    ignore any fact that may in any way serve to disclose them. And since my
    aim in these volumes is no other, I refuse
    out of hand to consider in a fact anything but its logico-experimental
    significance.

  <p id="section-0085">
    <strong>85.</strong>
    The one concession that I can make&mdash;and really it is not so much a
    concession as a grasp at some method for securing a far greater clearness by
    removing from the reader's eyes any veil that sentiment may have drawn
    across them&mdash;is to choose from the multitude of facts such as, in my
    judgment, will exert least influence upon sentiments. So when I have facts
    of equal experimental value before me from the past and from the present, I
    choose facts of the past. That accounts for my many quotations from Greek
    and Latin writers. In the same way, when I have facts of equal experimental
    value from religions now extinct and religions still extant, I give my
    preference to the former. But to prefer a thing is not to use it
    exclusively. In many many cases I am constrained to use facts from the
    present or from religions still existing, sometimes because I have no other
    facts of an equivalent experimental value, sometimes in order to show the
    continuity of certain phenomena from past to present. In such connexions I
    intend to write with absolute freedom; and the same frankness I maintain
    against the malevolence of our modern Paladins of Purity, for whom I care
    not the proverbial fig.<sup><a href="#footnote-0085-01" id="ref-0085-01">1</a></sup>

    In propounding this or that theory an author as a rule wants other
    people to assent to it and adopt it&mdash;in him the seeker after
    experimental truth and the apostle stand combined. In these volumes I keep
    those attitudes strictly separate, retaining the first and barring the
    second. I have said, and I repeat, that my sole interest is the quest for
    social uniformities, social laws. I am here reporting on the results of my
    quest, since I hold that in view of the restricted number of readers such a
    study can have and in view of the scientific training that may be taken for
    granted in them, such a report can do no harm. I should refrain from doing
    so if I could reasonably imagine that these volumes were to be at all
    generally read (§§ <a href="#section-0014">14</a>, <a href="#section-1403">1403</a>).<sup><a

    Long ago in my <i>Manuale</i>, Chap. I, § 1, I wrote: "It is possible for an
    author to aim exclusively at hunting out and running down uniformities among
    facts&mdash;their laws, in other words&mdash;without having any purpose of
    direct practical utility in mind, any intention of offering remedies and
    precepts, any ambition, even, to promote the happiness and welfare of
    mankind in general or of any part of mankind. His purpose in such a case is
    strictly scientific: he wants <em>to learn</em>, <em>to know</em>, and nothing more. I warn
    the reader that in this <i>Manual</i> I am trying exclusively to realize this last
    purpose only. Not that I underrate the others. I am just drawing
    distinctions between methods, separating them and indicating the one that is
    to be followed in this book. Anyone differently minded can find plenty of
    books to his liking. He should feast on them and leave this one alone, for,
    as Boccaccio said of his tales [<i>Decameron</i>, X, <i>Conclusione</i>], it does not go
    begging a hearing of anybody."
  </p>
  <p>
    Such a declaration seems to me clear enpugh, and I confess that I could not
    express myself in plainer terms. Yet I have been credited with intentions of
    reforming the world, and even been compared to Fourier!<sup><a href="#footnote-0087-01" id="ref-0087-01">1</a></sup>

    <strong>88.</strong> In general, this method of studying the social sciences is not grasped by
    literary economists, the cast of their minds being against any such thing.
    Then again they often discuss books and other writings that they know only
    at second hand, and which they have never read, or never read with the care
    required for understanding them. Finally, the person who has_always had some
    practical purpose in view can hardly be convinced that anyone can have a
    purely scientific aim; or if he does understand it for a moment, he
    immediately forgets. I have therefore little hope that the cautions I have
    voiced in this chapter will effectually prevent theories which I do not hold
    from being ascribed to me, similar warnings having failed on past occasions,
    though endlessly repeated. Yet it seems best to me to follow the maxim "Do
    what you ought, follow what may." Only I must beg my reader's pardon for
    certain repetitions that have no other justification, and which may appear
    superfluous&mdash;as they in fact are for anyone consenting to read what I

    <strong>90.</strong> We saw (§§ <a href="#section-0013">13</a>, <a href="#section-0063">63</a>)
    that our subclass of logico-experimental
    theories (I<i>a</i>) was divisible into two varieties, in one of which general
    principles were mere abstractions from experimental facts, while in
    the other they aspired more or less explicitly to an existence of their
    own not strictly dependent on mere abstraction from facts. The two
    varieties are often distinguished as based on the <em>inductive</em> or the
    <em>deductive</em> methods. But that is not exact. They differ not in the method
    they use, but in their respective criteria of truth for propositions and
    theories. In the strict type, I<i>a</i>1, whether propositions are obtained by
    induction or by deduction or by a mixture of the two, they are always
    subordinate to experience; whereas in the deviation from the type, I<i>a</i>2,
    they tend explicitly to dominate experience. When a general principle is
    corroborated by facts in large numbers as, for instance, the principles of
    Euclidean geometry or of universal gravitation are, the two varieties are
    not very sharply distinguished, for after all the experimental verification
    may often be taken for granted.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0091">
    <strong>91.</strong> But if the gap between the two varieties is very marked, a difference
    appears that is the better seen in a comparison between theories which are
    logico-experimental (I<i>a</i>) and theories which are not. In the former procedure
    is gradual. One starts with facts and reaches this or that abstraction,
    thence going on to a more general abstraction, becoming more and more
    circumspect, more and more cautious, the farther one gets from direct
    experience. In non-logico-experimental theories, a deliberate leap is taken
    away from direct experience, as broad a leap as possible, and the farther
    one gets from direct experience, the greater the assurance, the greater the
    recklessness. One is bent on knowing the "essences" of things, the only kind of
    knowledge worthy of the name of "science," direct experience and its
    implications being mere "empiricism," and as such held in poor esteem (§
    <a href="#section-0530">530</a>).

  <p id="section-0092">
    <strong>92.</strong> Working out a chemistry, for example, on that system, the first problem
    would be to know what "matter" is. Knowing that, we should know its chemical
    properties. The modern chemist, instead, following the methods and
    procedures of logico-experimental science, studies chemical properties
    directly, and gets more and more general properties or abstractions from
    them.

    The ancients thought that in imagining cosmogonies they were studying
    astronomy. Modern scientists study the movements of the stars directly, and
    go no farther than required for establishing uniformities in such
    movements. Newton found that a certain hypothesis, the so-called hypothesis
    of universal gravitation, was all that was required for discovering the
    equations governing the movements of the stars. But what is gravitation?
    Neither he nor his successors in celestial mechanics took the trouble to go
    too deeply into that question. Not that the problem was not worth
    considering; but celestial mechanics can dispense with a solution of it. So
    long as its equations hold, it matters little how they are obtained.

    Errors that are ancient history for the more advanced sciences recur or
    have their modern counterparts in the more backward sciences. So the theory
    of evolution has in some cases played a role in sociology similar to the role
    once played by cosmogony in astronomy. It was generally held that the only
    way to determine uniformities in social phenomena was to know the history of
    the latter and trace them back to their origins (§§ <a href="#section-0023">23</a>, <a

    <strong>94.</strong> for the theories that are to be elaborated in these volumes we cannot
    avoid going back to a distinction between the objective and the subjective
    phenomenon. However, we do not need to go beyond that and solve the problem
    as to the "reality of the external world" assuming (but not granting) that

    both mere thoughts of the mind; but if you dine at a London restaurant and
    try to pay your bill with the first of those thoughts, you will soon notice
    that just as "one thought is of another born," that thought will present you
    with a whole litter of offspring: first the thought of a policeman, which,
    whether objectively real or not, will hale you before the thought of a
    judge, which will introduce you to the thought of a well-barred jail,
    where you will meet a thought that the English call "hard labour," and
    which, according to all reports, is not the pleasantest thought in the
    world. All that will convince you that the two sheets of paper certainly
    belong to two sharply distinguished categories, since they give rise to
    differing facts&mdash;or differing thoughts, if you prefer.

    Similarly, when we assert that to know the properties of sulphuric anhydride
    one must appeal to experience and not, as Hegelian metaphysics would have
    it, to the "concept" of sulphur or even of oxygen, we are not in the least
    intending to set an external world over against an internal world, an
    objective reality over against a subjective reality. We can state the same
    proposition in a jargon that recognizes the "existence" of nothing but
    thought. We can say, that is, that to get the concept of sulphuric
    anhydride, it is not enough to have the mere concepts of sulphur and oxygen
    and meditate upon them. We could do that for century on century without
    getting concepts of sulphuric anhydride that would gibe with the concepts
    supplied by chemical experiment. The ancient philosophers thought that they
    could replace observation and experience in just that way, but they were
    entirely wrong. Chemistry is learned in laboratories and not by
    philosophical meditations, even of the Hegelian brand
    (§ <a href="#section-0014">14</a>). To get the
    concept, or concepts, of sulphuric anhydride we must first have the many
    concepts acquired through the concept otherwise known as experience&mdash;burning
    sulphur in oxygen or in air, and collecting the concept of sulphuric
    anhydride in the concept of a glass container&mdash;finally bringing all
    such concepts together to get the concept of the properties of sulphuric an
    hydride. But such a jargon would be prolix, tedious, ridiculous; and just to
    avoid it we use the terms "subjective" and "objective." For the
    logico-experimental purposes we have in view no other terms are required.

    In the same way and for the same reason it is enough for us to know that
    social facts reveal certain uniformities which are connected by ties of
    interdependence.<sup><a href="#footnote-0096-01" id="ref-0096-01">1</a></sup>
    We are not called upon to go to the trouble of finding
    out whether and just how that result yielded by observation can be
    reconciled with what is called free will (if indeed the latter phrase has
    any meaning). Such problems transcend the limits of our investigations.

    And we shall also neglect to inquire whether scientific laws have the
    trait of "necessity" (§ <a href="#section-0528">528</a>).
    On that point observation and experience can
    tell us nothing. They can only reveal certain uniformities, and those only
    within the limits of the time and space to which our observation and
    experience extend. Every scientific law, therefore, is subject to that
    qualification; and if, for considerations of brevity, it is omitted, the
    statement of every scientific law, must nevertheless be taken as prefaced by
    the restriction: <i>within the limits of time and space known to us</i>
    (§ <a href="#section-0069">69</a>-5).
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner we hold aloof from debates as to the necessity of the
    conclusion in a syllogism. The syllogism of the text-books on logic, for
    example, "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is
    mortal," from the experimental standpoint must be stated thus: "All men of
    whom we have had any knowledge have died; what we know of Socrates induces
    us to classify him with such men; therefore it is <em>very probable</em> that
    Socrates is mortal."
  </p>
  <p>
    That probability is greatly enhanced by other circumstances which we shall
    specify farther along (§§ <a href="#section-0531">531</a>,
    <a href="#section-0556">556</a>); and it is therefore greater, enormously
    greater, than the plausibility of a syllogism that might have been drawn
    before the discovery of Australia: "All the swans we have ever known have
    been white; a bird of unknown
    colour that has all the characteristics of the swan must be classed with the
    swans; therefore that bird will probably be white" (§
    <a href="#section-0526">526</a>). People reasoning
    on essences may sometimes substitute certitude for probability, even very
    great probability. But we know nothing about essences and accordingly lose
    our certitude.

    To assert, as some assert, that a miracle is impossible as violating the
    recognized constancy of natural laws is to reason in a circle and offer an
    assertion as proof of itself. If a miracle could be proved, the constancy of
    natural laws would at once go by the board. The kernel of the question
    therefore lies strictly in the proof of fact. We might add that such a
    proof has to withstand a scrutiny all the more severe, the farther it
    carries us outside the circle of known facts. If someone were to assert that
    the Sun is one day to carry its planetary system to a locality where the
    laws of chemistry, physics, and mechanics are different from the laws at
    present known, we could make no objection. We could only remind the prophet
    that the burden of proof rests upon the person making the assertion. As we
    have already stated (§ <a href="#section-0029">29</a>),
    we admit of no exceptions to this rule, even
    for the laws of logic.

    Scientific laws are for us, therefore, nothing more than experimental
    uniformities (§ <a href="#section-0069">69</a>-4).
    From that point of view there is not the slightest
    difference between the laws of political economy or sociology and the laws
    of other sciences. The differences that do exist are of an entirely
    different character, lying chiefly in the greater or lesser complexity with
    which effects of the various laws are intertwined
    (§ <a href="#section-1792">1792</a>). Celestial
    mechanics has the good fortune to be able to deal with the effects of a
    single law (uniformity). And that is not all, for the effects might be such
    as seriously to interfere with the discovery of the uniformity they
    manifest. But by a most happy circumstance, the mass of the Sun is much
    greater than the masses of the various planets, so that the uniformity is
    disclosed under a simple though not strictly exact form by assuming that the
    planets move around a fixed Sun; whence we can go on to rectify the error
    involved in the first
    approximation.<sup><a href="#footnote-0099-01" id="ref-0099-01">1</a></sup>
    Chemistry, physics, mechanics,
    are likewise able to deal with separate laws, or at least, by one device or
    another, to isolate
    effects;<sup><a href="#footnote-0099-02" id="ref-0099-02">2</a></sup>
    but then again, there are cases where the
    complex is hard to unravel. Such cases grow more numerous in biology and
    geology, and most of all in meteorology. It is with these latter that the
    social sciences are to be classed in this respect.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0100">
    <strong>100.</strong>
    Another difference in scientific laws lies in the possibility or
    impossibility of isolating their effects by experiment, which is here to be
    distinguished from observation. Certain sciences, such as chemistry,
    physics, mechanics, and biology, can and do make extensive use of
    experiment. Certain others can use it but sparingly; others, such as the
    social sciences, little if any; still others not at all, as for instance,
    celestial mechanics&mdash;at least as regards the movements of the heavenly
    bodies.

    Economic and social laws as well as the laws of the other sciences
    never suffer any genuine
    exception.<sup><a href="#footnote-0101-01" id="ref-0101-01">1</a></sup>
    To speak of a uniformity that is not
    uniform is to say a thing which has no meaning. What is commonly called an
    exception to a law is really the superposition of the effect of another law
    upon its own normal effects. From that standpoint all scientific laws, even
    the laws of mathematics, suffer exceptions. All bodies on the surface of the
    earth tend to move toward the centre; but a feather caught by the wind moves
    away from the centre, and a balloon filled with hydrogen rises in the air.
    The chief difficulty in a great many sciences lies in finding ways to
    unravel tangles of many different uniformities.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0102">
    <strong>102.</strong>
    To that end, it often helps to consider not the individual phenomena
    actually observed but average situations where the effects of certain laws
    are attenuated and those of others are emphasized. We cannot predict, for
    example, what the temperature on the tentn of June in some future year is
    going to be; but we can come pretty close to the mean temperature for the
    month of June, and closer still to
    the mean temperature over a three months' period for a number of years. No
    one can tell whether John Doe will live or die next year; but we can tell,
    approximately, how many people out of a hundred thousand of John Doe's age
    will die. Who can tell whether a given grain of wheat sown by a farmer will
    sprout and yield a return? But we can predict with reasonable probability
    the crop an acre of wheat will yield, and even better the average yield over
    a specified period of years.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0103">
    <strong>103.</strong> We must not forget that such averages are largely arbitrary, that they
    are formulated by ourselves for purposes of our own, and that therefore we
    must avoid the error of thinking of them as objective things having an
    existence independent of the facts. One often finds them going about under
    different names as metaphysical entities, used by scholars to fix on
    something at least that is constant in the flux of fact.
  </p>

  <p id="section-104">
    <strong>104.</strong> In political economy, for instance, we find that the wholesale
    prices of commodities differ in almost every transaction. To get a theory we
    have to have something less variable, something more constant, than that.
    Scientifically we consider averages, we strike medium curves
    (interpolations).<sup><a href="#footnote-0104-01" id="ref-0104-01">1</a></sup>
    Metaphysically, people have used an entity called value
    taken as a constant cause of variations in price. This second manner of
    reasoning easily leads astray, since it deprives averages of the status they
    have scientifically and gives them another that is altogether imaginary
    (§ <a href="#section-0062">62</a>).
    This statement, however, implies no criticism of early economists for
    using the term "value." But it was a notable step in advance when "exchange
    value" came to be distinguished from "utility value." Further progress
    derived the far more exact concept of "final utility" from the concept of
    "utility value"; and going on in that fashion, general theories of the
    economic equilibrium were finally attained. There is nothing unusual about
    such a course. It is the course the natural sciences have all followed (§§
    <a href="#footnote-0069-05">69<sup>5</sup></a>, <a href="#section-0106">106</a>).
    But just as it is no longer possible in our day to study
    celestial mechanics with the tools of Ptolemy or even of
    Kepler, so political economy can no longer be handled with the
    indeterminate concept of
    value.<sup><a href="#footnote-0104-02" id="ref-0104-02">2</a></sup>

    In a first approximation we may be satisfied with knowing that,
    roughly, we have discarded certain effects of minor importance as compared
    with others of major importance. But it is wiser to get at the earliest
    possible moment a fairly exact picture of what the terms "minor" and "major"
    imply, and to know approximately what has been discarded and what has been
    kept. It will be all the better to determine, if we can, the limits of the
    variations between the situation as it really is&mdash;the facts&mdash;and
    the picture which our averages or theories give us of it. In mathematics, it
    is already something to know that the fraction 22/7 expresses the
    approximate relationship of the circumference of a circle to the diameter.
    It is better yet to know that the actual ratio is greater than 22/7; still
    better to know that the error is less than 0.015, or that the true ratio
    lies between the fractions 22/7 and 333/106. It is a good thing to know that
    prices are not numbers varying haphazard. It is better yet to know that
    there is some relation between them and the tastes of human beings and the
    difficulties lying in the way of obtaining commodities. It is even better
    to have some notion of what that relation is, and better still to have the
    concept more exact and know the relative importance of the situation
    pictured by the theory, as compared with the real situation, and to know
    just what aspects it ignores.

    We can have only approximate concepts of concrete
    phenomena. A theory therefore can never account for all
    particulars. Divergences are inevitable, and the best we can do is reduce
    them to a minimum. And in this connexion too we are once more carried back
    to our successive approximations. Science is a continuous development; that
    is to say, every theory is supplanted by another which corresponds
    more closely to the real facts. The theory of yesterday has been perfected
    today; the theory of today will be improved on tomorrow; that of tomorrow,
    on the following day; and so on. Such the story that is to be read on every
    page of the history of the sciences, and no one can suppose that it will not
    continue to be the story for a long long time to come. Since no theory
    absolutely commands acceptance, of the theories among which we are free to
    select we shall prefer the one that diverges least from facts of the past,
    which best enables us to foresee the facts of the future, and which, in
    addition, embraces the greatest number of facts.

    In astronomy the theory of epicycles, which some people are at present
    trying to rehabilitate on sentimental grounds, satisfies the requirement of
    adequately picturing facts of the past as such facts are known to us. By
    multiplying the number of epicycles as often as is required, every movement
    of the stars that observation reveals can be represented; but we cannot, or
    cannot so well, foresee future movements, as is possible with the theory of
    gravitation. The latter theory, furthermore, utilizing the general law of
    mechanics, embraces a greater number of facts. Hence it is certainly to be
    preferred, as in fact is customary, to the theory of epicycles. But the
    choice is made for those reasons, or for others of the kind, not for
    metaphysical considerations as to the "essence" of things.

    small amount of information as to external facts we can derive, therefore,
    from knowledge of the processes of the human mind and from language. But
    that small amount is small indeed, and once a science is at all advanced,
    more errors than truths are obtained in that fashion

    The terms of common speech are lacking in definiteness, and it cannot be
    otherwise, for precision goes only with scientific exactitude. Every
    argument based on sentiment, as all metaphysical arguments are, must of
    necessity use terms lacking in exactness, since sentiments are indefinite
    and the name cannot be more definite than the thing. Such arguments,
    besides, actually rely on the lack of exactness in everyday language to mask
    their defects in logic and carry conviction (§
    <a href="#section-0109">109</a>). Logico-experimental
    arguments, being based instead on objective observation, tend to use words
    strictly to designate things and therefore to choose them in such a way as
    to avoid ambiguities and have terms as exact as possible. Moreover, they
    eventually equip themselves with a special, technical language and so escape
    the indefiniteness of common parlance.
  </p>
  <p>
    As already noted (§ <a href="#section-0069">69</a>-8),
    our purpose being to use logico-experimental
    reasoning exclusively, we shall exert every endeavour to use only words that
    are as far as possible precise and strictly defined and which correspond to
    things unequivocally and without ambiguities (§ <a href="#section-0119">119</a>),
    or better, with a minimum of error.
  </p>
  <p>
    A word designates a concept, and the concept may or may not correspond to a
    thing. But the correspondence, when it is there, cannot be perfect. Even if
    the word corresponds to a thing, it can never correspond to it exactly, in
    an absolute manner. It is always a question of a more or a less. Not only
    are there no such things, in the concrete, as geometric entities such as the
    straight line, the circle, and so on, but not even chemical substances that
    are <em>absolutely</em> pure, not even the species with which zoologists and
    botanists deal, not even an individual body designated by a name&mdash;for
    it would be further necessary to specify at just what moment it is
    considered: a piece of iron does not remain identical with itself if it is
    subject to changes in temperature, in electrical tension, and so on. In a
    word, the "absolute" has no place in logico-experimental science, and we
    must always take in a relative sense propositions that in the dress of
    ordinary parlance seem absolute; and in the same way too, we must make
    quantitative distinctions where common speech stops at the qualitative
    (§ <a href="#footnote-0144-01">144<sup>1</sup></a>).
    That much being clearly grasped, any
    misunderstanding is impossible; whereas to express ourselves always with
    absolute exactness would be to wallow in lengthy verbosities as useless as
    they would be pedantic.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may say, then, that we are carried outside the logico-experimental field
    entirely whenever we reason in terms which do not lie in that field; and
    that we are carried partially outside it whenever we reason in indefinite
    terms which correspond to experimental entities only in part (Chapter X).
    This last proposition must be taken in the sense that if our terms have that
    minimum of indefiniteness which corresponds to the present state of
    knowledge, they take us so little outside the experimental field that we may
    overlook the extrusion. Though there are no chemical substances that are
    absolutely pure, the laws of chemistry are valid, in very close
    approximation, for the substances that our methods of analysis designate as
    pure.

    People in the vast majority use common everyday language. A few
    scientists use scientific language in their specialties, outside of which
    they reason as badly as the plain man&mdash;and often worse. Human beings
    are prompted to acquire such knowledge as they have from common speech by
    two sorts of motives: first, because they assume that a word necessarily
    corresponds to a thing, whereby the name becomes everything and sometimes
    even acquires mysterious properties; and, second, because of the great ease
    with which a "science" can be so constituted, each person carrying within
    himself all that is required for that purpose, without going to the pains of
    long, difficult, and tedious researches. It is much easier to talk about
    antipodes than to go out and see if they are really there. To discuss the
    implication of a "principle of fire" or "damp" is much more expeditious than
    to prosecute all the field studies that have made up the science of
    geology. To ruminate on "natural law" is a much more comfortable profession
    than to dig out the legal codes of the various countries in various periods
    of history. To prattle about "value" and ask when and under what
    circumstances it is said that "a thing has value" is much less difficult
    than to discover and comprehend the laws of the economic equilibrium.
  </p>
  <p>
    In view of all that, one readily understands how the history of
    the sciences down to our time is substantially a history of the battles that
    the experimental method has had to fight and still has to fight against the
    methods of introspection, etymology, analysis of verbal expression. Defeated
    and put to rout in one place, the latter method bobs up in another. If it
    cannot fight in the open it dissembles, flattening out like a snake in the
    grass, and so succeeds in making its way into the very camp of the adversary

    Belief that the facts of the universe and their relationships could be
    discovered by introspection was general in a day gone by, and it still
    remains the foundation of metaphysics, which seeks a criterion of truth
    outside experience. In our day it found its complete expression in
    the lunacies of Hegel's <i>Philosophy of Nature</i>. One need hardly observe that
    mankind has never discovered the puniest uniformity in the facts of nature
    in that fashion (§§ <a href="#section-0050">50</a>, <a href="#section-0484">484</a>).

    The positivism of Herbert Spencer is nothing but a metaphysics. Though
    Spencer asserts the relative nature of all knowledge, he still speaks of the
    relations of knowledge to "absolute
    reality."<sup><a href="#footnote-0112-01" id="ref-0112-01">1</a></sup>
    He asserts the existence of
    an Unknowable, but claims, by an amusing contradiction, to know at least
    something about
    it.<sup><a href="#footnote-0112-02" id="ref-0112-02">2</a></sup>

    In all the rustle and bustle of our daily lives we cannot of course
    speak in the manner or with the severity of the
    logico-experimental sciences
    (§§ <a href="#section-0108">108</a>-09),
    and we are therefore led to ascribe great
    importance to words. Whenever we are able to give a name to a thing, it
    succeeds by that sole fact in finding a place in a class of objects of which
    the properties are known, and its properties therefore also become known.
    Furthermore&mdash;and it is the point that really matters&mdash;the thing is
    viewed in the light of the sentiments the name arouses, and it is to its
    advantage, therefore, to have a name that awakens favourable sentiments and
    to its disadvantage to have a name inspiring unfavourable
    sentiments.<sup><a href="#footnote-0113-01" id="ref-0113-01">1</a></sup>

    In practical life it would be difficult, nay impossible, to do otherwise. We
    cannot go to the bottom of all the multifarious questions that are at every
    moment arising&mdash;we cannot test everything in the crucible of doubt.
    Once we admit that a man's hat is his, that is the end of it; he puts it on
    his head and goes his way; and we could not, before permitting him to take
    it, debate the real nature of property, nor settle the problem of individual
    or collective property or other problems of the kind.

  <p>
    In civilized countries civil and penal laws have an exact terminology; and
    so in order to pass judgment upon an act one must first know the name by
    which it can be designated. Ordinary speech too has maxims in large numbers,
    which, save for exactness, in which they are usually wanting, are like the
    articles in a code of law; so for maxims too the name to be given to an act
    or a thing is of great importance. The legislator uses terms in the meanings
    they commonly have among the people for whom he is legislating. He need not
    wait for scientists to agree upon a definition of the term "religion" before
    he makes laws governing sacrilege, religious freedom, and the like. We talk
    of numberless things offhand, never exactly defining their nature and
    traits. Practical life evolves in the approximate. Science alone aims at the
    precise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within the sphere of that approximate we get theorems that correspond to
    facts so long as they are not extended beyond the scope, at times very
    limited, within which they are valid. Ordinary language crystallizes and
    preserves them, and it is there that we can
    recover and use them, but always with the reservation that, roughly
    approximative and true only within certain limits (which as a rule are
    unknown to us), they become false outside those limits (Chapter XI). Such
    theorems are theorems of words rather than of things; and we can therefore
    conclude that in practical life, for purposes of influencing others, and
    oftentimes in the early beginnings of the sciences, words are of great
    importance, and that it is by no means a waste of time to quarrel over them.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0114">
    <strong>114.</strong>
    But as regards investigations in experimental science our conclusion
    must be precisely opposite. Such researches envisage things exclusively, and
    can therefore derive no advantage from words." They can, however, incur
    great harm, whether because of the sentiments that words arouse, or because
    the existence of a word may lead one astray as to the reality of the thing
    that it is supposed to represent
    (§§ <a href="#section-0366">366</a>-67), and so introduce into the
    experimental field imaginary entities such as the fictions of metaphysics or
    theology; or, finally, because reasonings based on words are as a rule
    woefully lacking in exactness.

    So the more advanced sciences develop languages of their own as a result
    both of coining new terms and of giving special meanings to terms of
    ordinary parlance. The "water" of chemistry, the "light" of physics, the
    "velocity" of mechanics, have senses very different from the meanings of
    those identical words in everyday usage.

  <p id="section-0116">

    A simple device often serves to determine whether an argument is of
    the variety that relies on sentiment or on the assistance of the more or
    less vague notions stored up in the vernacular, or of the variety peculiar
    to experimental science. It is sufficient to substitute plain letters of
    the alphabet, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> . . . for the key-words in it.
    If the argument loses
    cogency, it belongs to the first class; if it retains its full vigor, it
    belongs to the second (§ <a href="#section-0642">642</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0117">
    <strong>117.</strong>. Like other sciences, political
    economy began by using terms from the vernacular, trying merely to give them
    meanings somewhat more exact; and so it became enriched with the wealth of
    experience accumulated in everyday language&mdash;a capital by no means
    inconspicuous, for economic operations make up a large fraction of human
    activity. But then gradually, as political economy progressed, that
    advantage waned, and the drawbacks involved in the use of such terms became
    more and more irksome. Jevons in his day very wisely dispensed with the word
    "value" which from being stretched in this, that, and every direction, and
    from having countless meanings, ended by having no meaning at all
    (§ <a href="#footnote-0062-01">62 <sup>1</sup></a>);
    and he proposed a new term, "rate of exchange," of which he gave an exact
    definition (§ <a href="#section-0387">387</a>).
  </p>

  <p id="section-0118">
    <strong>118.</strong>
    Literary economists did not follow him along that road; and they
    are to this day still dilly-dallying with speculations such as "What is
    <em>value</em>?" "What is <em>capital</em>?"
    They cannot get it into their heads that things
    are everything and words nothing, and that they may apply the terms "value"
    and "capital" to any blessed things they please, so only they be kind
    enough&mdash;they never are&mdash;to tell one precisely what those things
    are. If their arguments partook of experimental science, they would continue
    to hold even if blanks were used for the terms "value" and "capital"; for
    the name being taken away, the things still stand, and it is in things alone
    that experimental science is
    interested.<sup><a href="#footnote-0118-01" id="ref-0118-01">1</a></sup>
    But since such arguments are
    primarily rhetorical, they are strictly dependent on words capable of
    arousing the sentiments that are useful in convincing people; and that is
    why literary economists very properly are so much concerned
    about words and much less about things. Anyone asking what value <em>is</em>, what
    capital <em>is</em>, what income <em>is</em>, and the like,
    shows by that mere fact that he is
    concerned primarily with words and secondarily with things. The word
    "capital" certainly exists for him. What he is in doubt about is what it
    means, and he sets out to discover that. This procedure might be justifiable
    on a reasoning developed as follows: "There is something unknown that acts
    upon language and gives rise to the word 'capital.' <i>Since ordinary words are
      exact copies of the things they represent</i>, we can understand the thing by
    studying the word. So by finding out what capital is, we shall come to know
    the thing unknown." The fallacy in the justification lies in the proposition
    italicized. It is false. For more convincing proof one need simply
    substitute for the term "capital" some scientific term such as "water," and
    see whether the most painstaking inquiry as to what it is that is called
    water will ever reveal the properties of the chemically pure substance known
    by that name.
  </p>
  <p>
    In science the course followed is the exact opposite: first
    one examines the thing and then hunts up a name to give it. First one
    considers the substance formed by combining oxygen and hydrogen, and then a
    term is sought to designate it. Since the substance in question is present in
    great quantities in the vaguely defined thing that the ordinary vernacular
    designates as water, we call it water. But it might have been called
    otherwise&mdash;"lavoisier," for instance&mdash;and all of chemistry would
    stand exactly as it is. We would simply say
    that the liquid present in rivers and in the sea contains great quantities
    of lavoisier. Literary economists and sociologists do not understand such
    things, for they are wanting in the mental attitude and the training
    required for understanding them.

  <p id="section-0119">
    <strong>119.</strong> In these volumes we intend to keep
    strictly to the logico-experimental method (§ <a href="#section-0108">108</a>)
    and deal exclusively with
    things. Words therefore are of no importance whatever to us; they are mere
    labels for keeping track of things. So we say, "Such and such a thing we
    are going to call <i>A</i>"; or, "We suggest calling it <i>A</i>."
    We do not say&mdash;an
    entirely different matter&mdash;"Such and such a thing is <i>A</i>." The first
    proposition is a definition, and we are free to word it as we choose. The
    second is a theorem, and requires demonstration; but before we can prove it
    we have to know exactly what <i>A</i> is (§ <a href="#section-0963">963</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    To avoid in these volumes the danger, ever threatening in the social
    sciences, that meanings of words will be persistently sought not in the
    objective definitions supplied but in common usage and etymology, we would
    gladly have replaced word-labels with letters of the alphabet, such as <i>a, b,
      c</i> . . . or with ordinal numbers; and that we have done for some parts of our
    exposition (§ <a href="#section-0798">798</a>).
    We have refrained from doing so more often in fear lest
    our argument become altogether too tedious and obscure. So here we follow
    the example of the chemist who continues using the term "water" but gives it
    an exact meaning.<sup><a href="#footnote-0119-01" id="ref-0119-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    We too shall use terms of ordinary parlance, explaining exactly what they
    are to represent. We accordingly urge the reader to keep strictly to such
    definitions and never to try to guess from etymology or common usage the
    meanings of the technical terms that he finds in these volumes. The reader
    will shortly be meeting the terms "residues" and "derivations"
    (§ <a href="#section-0868">868</a>). If
    he desires to know what they mean, let him refer exclusively to the
    definitions we furnish. If he
    were to seek their meaning in etymology or common acceptation, he would be
    certain to find things very different from the things we label with them. If
    anyone does not like them, he may feel quite free to replace them with
    others&mdash;we shall never quarrel on that score. And he will see that with
    his own terms, or better yet, using letters of the alphabet or numerals, all
    our arguments will stand just the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyone finding these explanations superfluous must be patient. My excuse is
    that similar explanations ever and anon repeated for my term "ophelimity"
    did not prevent literary economists from seeking its meaning in etymology;
    while others, who must truly have had a deal of time to waste, began
    wondering whether "desirability" would not have been a better
    name.<sup><a href="#footnote-0119-02" id="ref-0119-02">2</a></sup> Nor
    could I silence such idle prattle by showing that we could very well do
    without "ophelimity" and all other similar terms in developing economic
    theories.<sup><a href="#footnote-0119-03" id="ref-0119-03">3</a></sup>

    In these volumes I shall use, for the reasons just stated, a number of
    terms that are also used in mechanics. I must accordingly make clear the
    exact senses in which I use them.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0121">
    <strong>121.</strong> Let <i>A, B, C</i> . . .
    stand for certain things that have a capacity for
    influencing an economic or social situation. We may consider the situation
    either at a moment when the action of such things is not yet exhausted, or
    at a moment when it is entirely spent. Let <i>A</i>, for instance, stand for an
    individual's desire to drink wine, and <i>B</i> for a fear he has that it may
    injure his health. The man drinks one glass of wine, then a second, and then
    he stops, because after the second glass the fear effectively curbs the
    thirst. After the first glass the movement is not complete: the thirst is
    still effective in spite of the fear. Not even the fear has completed its
    work, because it has not yet quenched the individual's desire for drinking
    wine. It is evident that when we are considering a situation we have to
    specify
    whether we are considering it at a time when the things <i>A, B</i> have not
    completed, or at a time when they have completed, their action.
  </p>
  <p>
    In mechanics there is an analogous situation&mdash;analogous, notice, not
    identical&mdash;where two forces are acting upon a physical point. So
    instead of speaking of two <em>things,</em> <i>A, B,</i> that have a capacity for
    influencing an economic or a social situation, we may for the sake of
    brevity speak of two forces, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0122">
    <strong>122.</strong>
    The intermediate stage in which the individual has drunk the first
    glass of wine and is about to drink another, in which, that is, the work of
    <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is not yet completed,
    is described in mechanics by saying that an
    equilibrium has not yet been attained. The stage in which both the thirst
    and the fear have completed their work, so that the individual ceases
    drinking, is described in mechanics by saying that an equilibrium has been
    attained. By analogy, not from identity, we may likewise use the term
    <i>equilibrium</i> for an economic or a social situation.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0123">
    <strong>123.</strong>
    But an analogy is not a definition; and we should be deliberately
    exposing ourselves to ready and frequent error were we satisfied with such
    an analogy to represent the social or economic equilibrium. We are therefore
    called upon to give an exact definition of the economic or social
    equilibrium in question; and the reader will find it in Chapter XII.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0124">
    <strong>124.</strong>
    Keeping to the definition of the thing, we can change the term at will
    and the arguments will stand just the same. For example, instead of calling
    <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> "forces,"
    we might call them "influences" ("operative things") or
    even "things <i>I."</i>
    The state defined above we might call <i>τέλος</i>, or even "state <i>X,"</i>
    instead of "equilibrium." In which cases all the arguments in which we have
    used the terms "forces" and "equilibrium" would still hold.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0125">
    <strong>125.</strong>
    It is therefore a monumental stupidity to say, as one critic said, that
    when I speak of a state of equilibrium, I am thinking of a state which I
    consider <em>better</em> than another state, equilibrium being better than lack of
    equilibrium!
  </p>

  <p id="section-0126">
    <strong>126.</strong>
    By similar analogy we can use other terms from mechanics in economics
    and sociology. Suppose we are considering a society in
    which private property exists. We may propose to study the possible forms of
    such a society, premising always the condition that private property exist.
    In the same way other relationships supply other conditions that we may
    assume or not assume as premises. Similar situations are met with in
    mechanics, and there the conditions in question are known as
    <em>ties</em> (<i>vinculo</i>).
    By analogy, we can use that term in economics and sociology as
    well.<sup><a href="#footnote-0126-01" id="ref-0126-01">1</a></sup>
    However, if there were no other analogies with mechanics it would be useless
    to do that, and better in particular not to use the term "tie."

  <p id="section-0127">
    <strong>127.</strong>
    Suppose we are considering a system of material points maintained by
    certain <em>ties</em>, and upon which certain forces <i>A, B, C</i>
    . . . are acting. The
    successive positions of the points will be determined by the resultant of
    the forces as modified by the ties. Now take a given group of individuals.
    Certain conditions prevail, such as private property, freedom (or slavery),
    technical training, wealth, scientific knowledge, religion, and so on.
    Active also in the group are certain individual desires, interests,
    prejudices, and the like. The successive states of the group may be assumed
    as determined by these latter elements working in conjunction with the
    conditions (the ties) premised.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0128">
    <strong>128.</strong>
    So by analogy&mdash;never from identity&mdash;we can call the group a
    social or an economic system and say that certain forces are acting upon it,
    which determine the position of the points in the system in conjunction with
    the ties. Considerations of brevity solely and strictly counsel the use of
    such terms, and as always they may be replaced by others at pleasure.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0129">
    <strong>129.</strong>.
    A transition from one state to another is called a <em>movement</em> in
    mechanics, and it may be so called in sociology also. In mechanics, if we
    assume that ties and forces are determined, movements in the system are
    likewise determined. So in sociology, if we assume conditions and active
    influences as given, the various successive states of
    the group are determined. Such movements are called <em>real</em> in mechanics, and
    may be so called in sociology.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0130">
    <strong>130.</strong>
    If, for theoretical purposes, we assume as suppressed some tie in a
    mechanical system, some condition in a sociological group, the mechanical
    system will show movements different from the real, and the sociological
    group will attain states other than those it really attains. Such movements
    are called <em>virtual</em> in mechanics, and <em>virtual</em> they may be called in
    sociology. For example, a person
    investigating what society would be like if private property were to be
    abolished is making a study in virtual movements.

    We can think of the "ties" and "forces" in the social system as summed
    together; and if we designate the aggregate by the term "conditions," the
    so-called theory of determinism could be stated by saying that the state of
    a system is wholly determined by "conditions" and can therefore change only
    with a change in
    "conditions."<sup><a href="#footnote-0131-01" id="ref-0131-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p id="section-0132">
    <strong>132.</strong>.
    Science has no dogmas, and so cannot and must not accept determinism <i>a
      priori</i>; and so far as it does accept it, it must, as always, do so strictly
    within the limits of the time and space that have been investigated. With
    that premise solidly established, experience indicates that in many cases
    social situations seem really to be determined by "conditions" and change
    only with changes in "conditions." In such cases we therefore recognize
    determinism, but without in the least precluding that there may be other
    cases where it cannot be
    granted.<sup><a href="#footnote-0132-01" id="ref-0132-01">1</a></sup>

    From the standpoint of the deterministic hypothesis, we are now called
    upon to solve a problem that is continually arising in one
    form or another in history and sociology. According to determinism,
    whatever happens cannot happen otherwise; and so the terms "possible" and
    "impossible" as used in ordinary language have no meaning, since only that
    is possible which happens, and what does not happen is impossible. We do not
    choose to quarrel over words; so if anyone is inclined to throw such terms
    overboard, let us do so by all means. All the same, after they have been
    dispensed with we are still confronted with the different things that were
    designated by them, and for which it will be expedient to find other
    designations.
  </p>
  <p>
    John Doe did not have his dinner yesterday, but speaking in ordinary terms,
    it was "possible" for him to dine. He did not cut off his head; but it was
    "impossible" for him to cut off his head, then glue it on again and be alive
    and well today. It may well be that from the standpoint of determinism the
    two things are equally impossible; but it is also evident that they are
    different kinds of things, and it would be a grave misfortune if we were
    unable to designate the different classes to which they belong. Suppose, for
    the moment, we label the first class (I) and the second (II). It is at once
    apparent that the difference between (I) and (II) lies in the fact that
    cases like (I) have been often enough observable, whereas no case like (II)
    has ever been seen.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0134">
    <strong>134.</strong>
    To be more exact: in both cases we are dealing with "virtual" movements;
    and in declaring them both impossible, determinism is merely calling them
    virtual as opposed to real movements. But there is more than one class of
    virtual movements. There is a class of virtual movements that take place when
    we assume as absent a certain tie which was not absent at the time the real
    movement in question was observed, but which has been found absent on other
    occasions, when real movements equivalent to the virtual movement have been
    observable. That movement therefore belongs in the class we have called (I)
    and which, in ordinary langauge, is a class of possible things. There is
    another class of virtual movements that would take place only if we assumed
    as absent a tie which has never been found absent, so that real movements
    equivalent to such virtual movements have never been observed. These belong
    to the class
    we have called (II), which in ordinary terms is a class of impossible
    things. Having so supplied exact definitions of the things that the terms
    "possible" and "impossible" designate, there can be no objection to using
    them even with the hypothesis of determinism.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0135">
    <strong>135.</strong>
    Of what conceivable use can the study of virtual movements be if they are
    things foreign to the domain of reality and only real movements actually
    occur? The advantages are, in chief, two:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. If we are considering virtual movements that have not been real because
    of the presence of ties which have been found absent on other
    occasions&mdash;if, in other words, we are considering movements that are
    virtual in some cases but are observable as real in others&mdash;knowledge
    of the virtual movements may help to foresee what the real movements are
    going to be like. Such, for instance, are forecasts as to the effects of a
    certain piece of legislation or of some other practical measure.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Consideration of virtual movements may help towards isolating and
    determining the character and peculiarities of a given social state.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0136">
    <strong>136.</strong>
    The propositions "<i>A</i> determines <i>B</i>" and
    "If there were no <i>A</i> there would
    be no <i>B</i>" state the same fact,
    in the one case as a function of <i>A</i>, in the
    other in terms of a virtual movement. The propositions "In such and such a
    state society has a maximum of <i>A</i>" and "If society departs from that state,
    there will be a diminution in <i>A</i>" express the same fact, in the first case as
    a description of the state, in the second in terms of a virtual movement.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0137">
    <strong>137.</strong>
    In the social sciences, virtual movements are to be resorted to with
    great caution, for very very often we have no means of knowing what the
    consequences of suppressing some condition, some tie, would be. If a person
    says, "If the Emperor Julian had continued very long on the throne, the
    Christian religion would not have survived," he is assuming that the
    death of Julian was alone responsible for the triumph of Christianity. And
    if one answers, "If the Emperor Julian had continued longer on the throne,
    he might have retarded, but could not have prevented, the triumph of
    Christianity," one is assuming that there were other conditions present
    which
    made that triumph certain. In general, propositions of this second variety
    are more often verifiable than are propositions of the first kind. In many
    cases, that is, social developments are determined by the concurrent action
    of large numbers of conditions; so that the removal of any one of them
    disturbs the course of events but slightly.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0138">
    <strong>138.</strong>
    Conditions, furthermore, are not independent. Many of them influence
    each other. Nor is that all. The effects of conditions react in turn upon
    the conditions themselves. In a word, social facts&mdash;that is to say,
    conditions and effects&mdash;are <em>interdependent</em>, and modifications in one of
    them react upon larger or smaller numbers of the others, and with greater or
    lesser intensities.

    That is why attempts to remake history by conjecturing what would have
    happened had a certain event never occurred are altogether fatuous. We have
    no way of determining all the changes that would have taken place on a given
    hypothesis if the hypothesis had come true. What would have happened had
    Napoleon won at Waterloo? Only one answer is possible&mdash;"We do not
    know."

    We can get something a little better by keeping to effects that are
    very immediate in a very limited field, and progress in the social sciences
    will tend gradually to enlarge those very restricted confines. Every time
    we succeed in discovering some hitherto unknown relation between social
    facts, we are a little better prepared to know what the effects of certain
    changes in the social situation will be; and pushing on along that road we
    make new advances, however slight, towards realizing the purpose of
    determining the probable course of social developments in the future.
    Therefore no study that aims at discovering some uniformity in the relations
    of social facts can be called useless. It may be useless at the present time
    and continue to be so in any near future; but we cannot be sure that the day
    will not come when, taken in conjunction with other discoveries, it will
    contribute towards forecasting probabilities in social evolution.

    The difficulties in discovering social uniformities are great because
    of the great complexity of social phenomena. They are immeasurably
    increased, and in fact become insuperable, when
    uniformities are sought not with the one and undivided intent of discovering
    them, but with the purpose, explicitly chosen or tacitly set by sentiment,
    of justifying a preconception, a doctrine, a faith. Just such impediments
    account for the present backward state of the social sciences.
  </p>

  <p id="section-0142">
    <strong>142.</strong>
    The man entirely unaffected by sentiments and free from all bias, all
    faith, does not exist; and to regard that freedom as an essential
    prerequisite to profitable study of the social sciences would amount to
    saying that such study is impossible. But experience shows that a person
    can as it were divide himself in two and, to an extent at least, lay aside
    his sentiments, preconceptions, and beliefs when engaged in a scientific
    pursuit, resuming them afterwards. That was the case with Pasteur, who
    outside his laboratory was a devout Catholic, but inside kept strictly to
    the experimental method. And before Pasteur one might mention Newton, who
    certainly used one method in discoursing on the Apocalypse and quite another
    in his <i>Principia</i>.

    Such self-detachment is more readily achieved in the natural sciences
    than in the social sciences. It is an easy matter to look at an ant with the
    sceptical disinterestedness of experimental science. It is much more
    difficult to look at human beings that way. But even if complete success in
    such an effort is impossible, we can at least try, to succeed in part, and
    reduce the power and influence of sentiments, preconceptions, beliefs, to a
    minimum. Only at that price can progress in the social sciences be
    achieved.

    Social facts are the elements of our study. Our first effort will be to
    classify them for the purpose of attaining the one and only objective we
    have in view: the discovery, namely, of uniformities (laws) in the relations
    between them. When we have so classified kindred facts, a certain number of
    uniformities will come to the surface by induction; and after going a good
    distance along that primarily inductive path, we shall turn to another
    where more ample room will be found for deduction. So we shall verify the
    uniformities to which induction has carried us, give them a less empirical,
    more theoretical form, and see just what their implications are, just what
    picture they give of society.

    In general we have to deal with things that vary by imperceptible degrees,
    and our picture of them approximates reality the more closely in proportion
    as it is drawn in <em>quantitative</em> terms. That fact if often recognized by
    saying that as sciences progress, they tend to become more and more
    quantitative. But that is much more difficult than to study
    merely qualitative differences. In fact, the first forward step lies always in a
    rough quantitative
    approximation.<sup><a href="#footnote-0144-01" id="ref-0144-01">1</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is no difficult matter to distinguish day from night with tolerable
    accuracy. Though there is no precise instant at which day ends and night
    begins, we can after all roughly say that there is a qualitative difference
    between them. It is more difficult to divide such periods of time into
    parts. We manage to do so approximately by saying "shortly after sunrise,"
    "towards noon," and the like; and with more or less success&mdash;less
    rather than more&mdash;the night used to be divided into "watches." When
    clocks came to be available, it was possible to get quantitative
    measurements of time, the exactness increasing with improvements in clocks
    and becoming very considerable with the modern chronometer.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a long time people were satisfied with knowing that the death-rate was
    higher among the aged than among the young, no one as usual knowing very
    definitely where youth ended and old age began. Then something more was
    learned; statistics were made available, very imperfect statistics at first,
    then better ones, now fairly good ones&mdash;and they are steadily
    improving. For a long time there was very little of the quantitative about
    political economy.
    Then it became quantitative in pure economics&mdash;in theory at least. For
    sociology we shall try as far as we can to replace qualitative
    considerations with considerations of quantity. Imperfect, very imperfect,
    as they may be, they will at any rate be a little better than the
    qualitative. We shall do what we can, our successors will do
    better&mdash;and so science advances!
  </p>
  <p>
    In these volumes we shall confine ourselves to a very general
    picture&mdash;something like a sphere offered as a model of the Earth. That
    is why I call this a <em>general</em> sociology. Details will still be left for
    future study&mdash;much as oceans, continents, and mountains have to be
    drawn in on the sphere of the Earth. Such studies would make up a <em>special</em>
    sociology. Incidentally, however, we shall examine not a few special themes
    in the course of these volumes; for we shall be meeting them all along the
    path we shall have to traverse in getting our picture of society in
    general.

        Naville appeared in the <i>Revue de théologie et de philosophie</i>, Sept.-Oct., 1915,
        excellently urging against the theories of Bergson ideas similar to those
        above. The conclusions of a thinker of Naville's distinction are well worth
        noting. Says he, p. 18: "As regards the theory of the two truths and the
        case made against science, I have come to the conclusion that science is
        limited, relative, in part conventional, that it is immersed in mystery, and
        leaves open a whole world of questions partaking of the nature of
        transcendental speculation; but that meantime in its own domain and in the
        fields where it pronounces judgment, there is no authority higher than its
        own." Just previously Naville had said, p. 3: "A strange development has
        taken place in our day. The sovereignty of science has been brought under
        fire, and not by backward minds stifled in routine, not by partisans of
        ignorance and of a dogma concerned to endure for ever unchanged, but by most
        wide-awake, most open-minded, most active intelligences. Science is being
        called to the bar by very enlightened and
        very daring innovators. . . . Not that the cult of science has entirely
        disappeared. One might even say that it has become wide-spread and that
        worshippers of science are more numerous today than fifty years ago. The
        masses at large are professing for science a reverence that seems to be on
        the increase [§ <a hre="#section-2392">2392</a href>] and their leaders are encouraging that attitude in
        them. . . . But if science has maintained all its prestige for those who
        move on the lower or middle planes of the intellectual world, the case is
        different with those who dwell on the summits. These latter have grown
        mistrustful of science&mdash;they are talking back, criticizing, drawing up
        an indictment and demanding an answer." After reviewing a number of such
        criticisms, Naville continues, p. 16: "M. Bergson . . . is one of the severest
        critics that science has ever had. Not that he despises the thing, by any
        means; he vaunts its merits as loudly as anyone, but only on condition that
        science attend to its own business, which is, one might say, to formulate
        the truth that is useful and not the truth that is true. The truth that is
        true can be obtained only by procedures that are altogether different from
        the procedures of science."
      </p>
      <p>
        So by plain observation of facts and without any preconceived theories,
        Naville is led to note a particular case of a phenomenon of which we shall
        state the general theory in Chapter XII (§§ <a href="#section-2339">2339</a> f.); and in the same way he
        goes on to note other particular cases of the same thing, p. 6: "That there
        are two truths [Two? There are an infinite number of truths:
        <i>quot homines tot sententiae!</i>]&mdash;the one profound,
        philosophy, the other less profound
        and, in a word, less true&mdash;is a thesis that has frequently turned up in
        the course of history."" From the standpoint of logic and experience, this
        notion of a number of different truths is a vagary without head or tail, a
        hotchpotch of meaningless words; but from the standpoint of sentiments and
        the social or individual utility of sentiments (§§ <a href="#section-1678">1678</a> f.) it expresses, be
        it only by combating one error with another, the discrepancy between
        experience, and the dogma that non-logical actions originate
        exclusively in outworn, absurd, and pernicious prejudices (§ <a href="#section-1679">1679</a>). Says
        Naville, pp. 7-8: "In Western Europe it [the theory or the two truths] came
        to the fore with particular aggressiveness in the latter centuries of the
        Middle Ages. Its appearance marked the decline and heralded the demise of
        Scholasticism. Scholasticism had been an alliance between Church doctrine
        and philosophy. There were two Scholasticisms in Europe, the one Christian,
        the other Judaic. . . . When Greek came to be known and acquaintance with
        Aristotle to be intimate, the Church had to decide whether to turn her back
        on Greek science and thought or accept them as auxiliaries and allies. She
        adopted the latter course, and the alliance was Scholasticism. The Jewish
        synagogue did likewise. . . . All the same, the alliance between Church
        doctrine and philosophical speculation had not been struck on a footing of
        equality. The Church claimed the upper hand&mdash;she was mistress: and
        philosophical research, free within certain limits, was not expected, to
        overstep them. Towards the close of the Middle Ages the number of
        emancipated minds progressively increased, and then the theory of the two
        truths came quite generally to the fore in university circles, notably at
        Paris and at Padua."
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time the theory served as a bridge between the theology of sentiment
        and the theology of reason, and its indirect consequences were favourable to
        experimental science. Today the theory is serving as a bridge between the
        theology of reason and the theology of sentiment; and it may again turn out
        to be to the benefit of experimental science by demonstrating
        experimentally the individual and social udlity of non-logical conduct. And

      <p>69 <a href="#ref-0069-05"><sup>5</sup></a> As always we use the terms "exact," "exactness," in the sense
        designated in §§ <a href="#section-0108">108</a> and <a href="#section-0119">119</a> x. They are applied to
        terms that designate
        things with the closest
        approximation possible. The chemist does not reject the term "water" for
        pure water&mdash;as pure, that is, as can be obtained with the means at
        present at our command; but he would reject it as a designation for
        sea-water. The mathematician knows very well that there is no number that,
        when multiplied by itself, gives 2&mdash; which is, in other words, the
        square root of 2; but he does not scruple to use a number as approximate as
        is required for the calculation he has in hand, say the number 1.414214; yet
        he would refuse to use the number 5 for the same computation. Mathematicians
        have proceeded as though a square root of 2 (in general, an irrational
        number) existed. They have now come to recognize the necessity of using
        instead two classes of real numbers, the first containing all rational
        numbers with squares less than 2, the second, all rational numbers with
        squares larger than 2. The example is noteworthy on two accounts:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. It illustrates the continuous development of science, by showing how in a
        science as perfect, as exact, as mathematics improvements in the direction
        of greater perfection and exactness have still been possible. Similar
        improvements might be mentioned in mathematical series, and in many
        mathemadcal demonstradons.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. It is an example of successive approximation in the sense of gradual
        progress towards greater and greater exactness. The mathematicians of
        andquity wisely avoided the risk of losing their way among such nicedes, and
        modern mathematicians have just as wisely gone into them. The ancients were
        paving the way for the moderns; the moderns are paving the way for their
        successors. Hipparchus, Kepler, Newton, Laplace, Gauss, Poincare, represent
        successive approximations in celestial mechanics. Hegel reached the absolute
        in one bound; but there is this difference between his speculations and the
        theories of those scientists: With Hegel's theories one could not locate a
        star, however indefinitely&mdash;he leaves one in the fix of a mathematician
        taking 100 as the square root of 2; whereas with scientific theories one may
        determine those locations roughly and with closer and closer approximation,
        being in the position of the mathematician utilizing some value such as
        1.414214 as the square root of 2. We arc trying to follow in sociology the
        path trodden before us by astronomers, physicists, chemists, geologists,
        botanists, zoologists, physiologists, in short, by all natural scientists of
        modern times; and to avoid, so far as within us lies, the road that led the
        Church Fathers to denying the existence of antipodes, and Hegel to prattling
        about mechanics, chemistry, and other similar sciences&mdash;and which is
        generally followed by metaphysicists, theologians, and men of letters in
        studies that they pretend deal with facts of nature but which in reality are
        a mere hotchpotch of sentiments.

        method of successive approximations in my <i>Cours</i> and <i>Manuale</i>. For sociology a
        good example is available in Marie Kolabinska's

        The writer wisely centred on the main elements in her problem,
        disregarding the secondary. That method is the only one that can be followed

        divagations of that ethical literature which is still passed off as
        sociology. Many further examples of successive approximations will be found

        all
        it is more apparent than real, since it aims at clearer explanation, by an
        example, of the objective fact here in point. I shall have occasion hereafter
        to speak unfavourably, very much so, of certain acts by Athenian demagogues.
        Now I do not imagine the reader is especially concerned to know
        my global personal attitude towards the ancient Athenian republic. However,
        if I may be allowed to state it, I will say that I do not think anyone
        admires or loves the Greek mind more than I do. I shall poke fun at the
        "goddess Science," yet the fact stands that I have devoted my life to
        experimental sciences. One may ridicule the democratic humanitarianism of
        this or that French politician and still hold the scientists of that country
        in highest esteem, and even regard the republican form of government as
        perhaps the best for France. One may note the licentiousness of certain
        emancipated women in the United States and still cherish the deepest
        reverence for the many admirable wives and mothers who are to be found in
        that country. Finally, to point the finger of scorn at the hypocrisies of
        German sex-reformers is not inconsistent with admiration for their mighty
        nation and reverence for German scholarship. I deem it superfluous to note
        similar contrasts in the case of my own country, Italy. That is my whole
        confession. I urgently beg the reader to be convinced that this exception
        will have no counterparts. These volumes should be read not for something
        that is not there&mdash;a statement, namely, of my personal

        application of the formula is 0.550. Using the formula to estimate
        population for the year 1910, we get 37.816, while the actual population was
        35.796. The difference is +2.020, a figure much greater than the maximum

        Running, as it does, counter to the general trend in the social
        sciences, this work will be severely criticized by all individuals whose
        minds are closed to innovations from a habit of drifting with that current.
        They state the problem of
        judging a theory in the terms: "Is it in accord with the theories I consider
        good?" If the answer is yes, they classify it with the good theories, if no,
        with the bad. It is obvious enough that being at variance with all such
        theories, this one of mine will certainly be bad. It may find a warmer
        welcome among young people whose minds are not yet clogged with the
        preconceptions of orthodox science and among people who state the problem of
        judging a theory in the terms: "Is it in accord with the facts?" I must have
        made it sufficiently clear by this time that that is the only accord I seek,
        and that I have no interest whatsoever in anything else.

        In the year 1909 and with the <i>Manuale</i>, which had appeared in 1906,
        before his eyes, Professor Gide, <i>Histoire des doctrines économiques</i>, p. 623,
        was able to write: "The Hedonists [Among whom Gide counts V. Pareto&mdash;on
        what grounds, he only knows] are very reticent as regards the possibilities
        of realizing their economic world. On the other hand they are very positive,
        in fact a little too much so, as regards the virtues of their method, not
        being exempt on that score from a dogmatic conceit that reminds one of the
        utopian Socialists. One seems to be listening to Fourier when one reads that
        'what has already been discovered in political economy is nothing as
        compared with what may be discovered hereafter'&mdash;by the mathematical
        method, of course." Gide ascribes his quotation to one "V. Pareto, ["<i>Le
          nuove teorie economiche</i>"], <i>Giornale degli economisti</i>, September, 1901." Even
        if the quotation were exact, M. Gide might at least have noted that V.
        Pareto had changed his views, as is apparent enough from his <i>Manuale</i>. But it
        is not exact, for M. Gide is thinking of <em>practice</em>, whereas I was thinking
        strictly of <em>pure theory</em>! A
        good guess would be that M. Gide had not read the article from which he
        quoted. My article says, p. 239: ". . . Now the outstanding trait in the new
        economic theories is that they are the only ones so far to have given us a
        general picture of the economic phenomenon as a whole. The picture is just
        approximative, much like a sphere offered as a model of the Earth. All the
        same we know of nothing better." On p. 241, as to "the equations of pure
        economics," I clearly state that they are of service only as instruments for
        study, much as it is of service to know, for instance, the dimensions of the
        terrestrial ellipsoid. On p. 242: "Pure economics, one may say, has indeed
        found the tool for its researches, but it has hardly begun to use it.
        Practically everything along that line is still to be done; and economists
        really devoted to the progress of their science ought to set about doing
        it." I was speaking of science, pure science, and not of practical
        applications, as Gide's allusion to Fourier would insinuate. I conclude, p.
        252, with the quotation that Gide detached from its context&mdash;with a
        remodelling to boot: "We are in the first stages of the new science, and
        what it has already achieved is nothing as compared with the results it may
        achieve hereafter. The present state of pure economics is not even
        comparable to the state of astronomy after the appearance of Newton's
        <i>Principia</i>." The parallel I drew was with an abstract science, astronomy, not
        with a concrete science. In the rest of his article Professor Gide continues
        to ascribe to me opinions and theories that I have never held and which I
        have even disputed as directly opposite to theories actually mine. For
        further details see my article, <i>Économie mathématique</i>, in the <i>Encyclopédie
          des sciences mathématiques</i> [Meyer, Vol. I, pp. 1094-1120, <i>s. v. Anwendungen
          der Mathematik auf Nationalökonomie</i>; Molk, Vol. I, pp. 591-640] and in
        <i>Giornale degli economisti</i>, Nov., 1906, p. 424.

        "democratic"! It has been said, in black and white, that it was

        interested strictly in uniformities (laws) among facts is nothing of any of

        uniformities, and that is the end of it. Personally, I was a free-trader in

        In my <i>Manuale</i> I showed that economic theories can just as well be
        elaborated without mention of the terms "value," "price," "capital," and the
        like. Literary economists cannot see it that way; and to an extent they are
        right, since for them the term "capital," let us say, designates not a thing
        but a sum of sentiments, and naturally enough they want to keep a term to
        designate that sum. To humour them, the thing might be called "objective
        capital," and the complex of sentiments "subjective capital." Then one could
        say: "Economic theories concerned exclusively with investigating
        relationships between economic facts have nothing to do with the concept
        'subjective capital.' They may or may not, as they choose, utilize the
        concept 'objective capital.' " And going on: "Economic theories that aim at
        making converts and thereby at achieving some practical result can turn the
        concept of 'subjective capital' to good account, converts being made by
        appeals to sentiment. For that reason it is the wiser part for them to
        create a confusion between the notions of 'objective capital' and
        'subjective capital,' so that the scientific argument will not avail against
        the sentimental argument." At some few points such theories approximate the
        concrete more closely than the theories of pure
        economics, for they inject into the concept of "subjective capital"
        sociological notions that have no place in scientific economics. But they
        still have the fatal defect of being entirely devoid of exactness. If one
        would get closer to the concrete, instead of introducing sociological
        concepts implicitly and as it were by stealth, it would be better to advance
        them openly: that would make at least a certain amount of definiteness
        unavoidable. All such things can be better seen from Sensini's <i>La teoria
          della rendita</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept "subjective capital" becomes of prime importance to sociology,
        which is in fact directly concerned with the sentiments expressed in such
        terms; and since the concrete phenomenon is both economic and sociological,
        anyone studying it in applied economics inevitably encounters notions
        analogous to "subjective capital." That is why, in my <i>Manuale</i>, I examined
        concrete phenomena not only from the strictly economic standpoint, but also
        as regards the manners in which they are conceived by the individuals
        involved in them (see the caption <i>Veduta soggettiva</i> in the index to the
        <i>Manuale</i>).

        One should here recall the points alluded to in

        nothing absolute in logico-experimental science. Here the term "exact" means
        "with the least possible margin of error." Science tries to bring theory as
        close to the facts as possible, knowing very well that absolute coincidence
        cannot be attained. If, in view of that impossibility, anyone refuses to be
        satisfied with approximate exactness, he had better emigrate from this
        concrete world, for it has nothing better to offer.

        that everything can be explained, and what the scientist wants is
        explanations. Determinism is the conviction that all phenomena can be
        understood, associated, that is, with other phenomena that envelop and
        produce them. . . . But however natural the inclination [to determinism] may

        The terms "quality," "quantity," "qualitative," "quantitative," will
        at all times be used in these volumes not in any metaphysical sense but in
        the sense commonly used in chemistry in contrasting qualitative with
        quantitative analysis. The one shows, for instance, that a given substance
        is an alloy of gold and copper; the other shows the weight of gold and the
        weight of copper present in a given weight of the alloy. Whenever we note
        the presence of a certain element in a sociological complex, we are stating
        a qualitative proposition. When we are in a position to designate, however
        roughly, the intensity of that element, our proposition becomes
        quantitative. Unfortunately no scales are available for weighing the things
        that are dealt with in sociology, and we shall generally have to be
        satisfied with designating quantities by certain indices that increase or
        diminish with the thing itself. An interesting example of that method
        applied to political economy is provided in my use of indices of ophelimity
        (see my <i>Manuale</i>, Appendix).
